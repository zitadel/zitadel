Always respect the terminology defined in the 'Technical Glossary' section of agents.md when generating UI text or documentation.

For deployment-related work, also consult the directory-specific agents files (e.g., `deploy/compose/agents.md`) for invariants, file conventions, and rejected alternatives.
