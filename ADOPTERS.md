## Adopters

Sharing experiences and learning from other users is essential. We are frequently asked who is using a particular feature of Zitadel so people can get in touch with other users to share experiences and best practices. People also often want to know if a specific product or platform has integrated Zitadel. While the Zitadel Discord Community allows users to get in touch, it can be challenging to find this information quickly.

The following is a directory of adopters to help identify users of individual features. The users themselves directly maintain the list.
