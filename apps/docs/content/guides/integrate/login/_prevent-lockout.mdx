<Callout type="warn" title="Don't Lock Yourself Out of Your Instance">
    Before you change your Zitadel configuration, we highly recommend you to create a service account with a personal access token (PAT) and the IAM_OWNER role.
    In case something breaks, you can use this PAT to revert your changes or fix the configuration so you can use a login UI again.
