After starting the WebAuthN authentication on the side of Zitadel you have to challenge the browser.
To do this you need to call the browser API to get the credentials.
Make sure to send the public key credential request options you got from Zitadel.

```javascript
const credential = await navigator.credentials.get({
    publicKey: publicKeyCredentialRequestOptions
});
```

Read the [WebAuthN Guide](https://webauthn.guide/#authentication) for more information about "Authenticating with a WebAuthN Credential".
