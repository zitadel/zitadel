If you started with Zitadel before version 3, you might have the "Human User [deprecated]" UI.
In this case please enable the Feature Flag "Use V2 Api in Management Console for User creation" in the Default Settings.

        When creating a new user you have different options.
        First add the email, and select if the email address should be added automatically as "verified".

        In the last section you can choose the authentication options:
        - **Setup authentication later for this user**: This flow might be useful if an employee starts at a later point but you already want to prepare the account. The user will not have an authentication method, before they will be able to login, they need to setup a method.
        - **Send an invitation E-Mail for authentication setup and E-Mail verification**: The user will receive an email and be able to setup an authentication method (e.g Password, Passkey, External SSO).
            - When using the [Zitadel Login V1](/guides/integrate/login/hosted-login) the user will be prompted to setup a password
            - When using the [Zitadel Login V2](/guides/integrate/login/hosted-login#hosted-login-version-2) the user has the option to choose the authentication method (password, passkey, identity provider), based on the settings of the organization

        - **Set an initial password for the user**: The user will receive an email and be able to setup an authentication method (e.g Password, Passkey, External SSO)

        After a user is created, by default, an initialization mail with a code is sent to the registered email. This code then has to be verified on first login.
        If you want to omit this mail, you can check the **email verified** and **set initial password** toggle.
        If no password is set initially, the initialization mail prompting the user to set his password is sent.

    <Tab value="service" label="Service Account">

        />
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can prompt the user to add a second factor method too by checking the **Force MFA** toggle in [Login behaviour settings](/guides/manage/console/default-settings#login-behavior-and-access).

When logged in, a user can then manage the profile in the management console, adding a profile picture, external IDPs and Passkeys.
