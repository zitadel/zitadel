To configure administrators in ZITADEL, go to the resource where you like to add it (e.g., Instance, Organization, Project, GrantedProject).
In the right part of the management console you can find **ADMINISTRATORS** in the details part. Here you have a list of the current administrators and can add a new one.

## Configure roles

If you run a self-hosted ZITADEL instance, you can define your custom roles by overwriting the defaults.yaml
In the InternalAuthZ section you will find all the roles and which permissions they have.

Example:

```bash
InternalAuthZ:
  RolePermissionMappings:
    - Role: "IAM_OWNER"
      Permissions:
        - "iam.read"
        - "iam.write"
```

## Administrator Permission Matrix

This table is generated dynamically from our settings file.

<PermissionTable data={permissionData} />
