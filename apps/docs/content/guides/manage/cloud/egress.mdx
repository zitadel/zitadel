When configuring your firewall or network security groups, you may need to allow traffic **from** ZITADEL Cloud to your internal infrastructure.

This page lists the static Egress (outgoing) IP addresses used by ZITADEL Cloud regions.

## When do I need this?

You need to allowlist these IP addresses if you use features where ZITADEL initiates a connection to your systems. This is commonly required for the following scenarios:

### [Identity Providers & Federation](/guides/integrate/identity-providers/introduction)
If you are federating an external Identity Provider (IdP) that sits behind a firewall:
* **LDAP / Active Directory:** When ZITADEL connects to your LDAP server (typically port `636` for LDAPS).
* **OIDC / OAuth:** When ZITADEL connects to your IdP for:
  * **Discovery:** Fetching configuration from `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
  * **Token Exchange:** Exchanging the authorization code at the `token_endpoint`.
  * **User Info:** Retrieving user details from the `userinfo_endpoint`.
  * **Keys:** Fetching signing keys from the `jwks_uri`.
* **SAML:** If ZITADEL needs to fetch the `metadata.xml` or artifact resolution services from an internal SAML IdP.

### [Notification Providers](/guides/manage/customize/notification-providers)
* [**SMTP:**](/guides/manage/customize/notification-providers#smtp-providers) If you configured a custom SMTP sender pointing to your own mail server.
* [**Webhook / HTTP provider:**](/guides/manage/customize/notification-providers#webhook-http-provider) If you use a custom gateway for SMS or Emails.

## IP Addresses by Region
