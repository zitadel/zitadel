### Payment Method

If you click on the "+" Button a popup will be shown with the needed fields to add a new payment method.
At the moment we provide only "Credit Card" payment

Once a payment method is configured, it can be selected directly in the instance creation process.

## Customer

To be able to create correct billings we will need some customer information from you.
This includes the following fields:

- Name
- Country
- Email address
- Address line 1
- Address line 2
- Postal Code
- City

## Tax ID

If available, enter your tax ID type and VAT number.
The tax ID will be shown on the invoice.

<Callout title="Reverse Charge">
When you enter the tax ID we will automatically calculate taxability.
Depending on your billing address we will mark the invoice as reverse charge.
</Callout>

## Update Billing Information

You will only need to add billing information if your want to get the pro tier. There are two options on how to add your billing info.

1. Go to the billing menu and add a new payment method.
2. Add the billing information directly during the upgrade process.

## Invoices

We show all you invoices, and you are able to download them directly in the Customer Portal.
