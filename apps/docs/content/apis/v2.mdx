title: APIs V2 (Generally Available)
description: "Explore ZITADEL APIs V2. Organize access by resource and simplify API integration for multi-organization use cases."

import DocCardList from '@/components/docusaurus/doc-card-list';

APIs V2 organize access by resources (users, settings, etc.), unlike context-specific V1 APIs.
This simplifies finding the right API, especially for multi-organization resources.

Users created with the V2 API have no initial state anymore, so new users are immediately active.
Requesting ZITADEL to send a verification email on user creation is still possible.
