### Resources
- [Flutter Example Application Repository](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel_flutter)
- [Step-By-Step Guide](/examples/login/flutter) to create your Flutter App with Zitadel Login
- [Dart Client Library for Zitadel](https://github.com/smartive/zitadel-dart)

### Flutter SDK

Zitadel doesn't provide a specific Flutter SDK for authentication in your Web/Mobile App.
You can use any OIDC Library such as [package:oidc](https://pub.dev/packages/oidc).
For Mobile Apps we recommend [Flutter AppAuth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_appauth).

Check out our [Example Application](/sdk-examples/flutter#example-application).

Additionally, you can use [smartive/zitadel-dart](https://github.com/smartive/zitadel-dart) for user and resource management.
- Manage Resources through Zitadel APIs
  - Authenticate Service User
  - Generated gRPC Clients for integrating Zitadel API
  - User, Organization, Project, etc. Management

<Callout>
This library is built by our community.

### Example Application

The [zitadel-flutter](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel_flutter) repository includes an Example Application ready to start and show how an Flutter application looks like with integrated Zitadel Login.

What does the Example include:
- Home Page with Login Button
- Authenticating user with OIDC PKCE Flow
- Private Page: Only accessible after login

### Step-By-Step Guide

The [Step-By-Step Guide](/examples/login/flutter) leads you through the whole process from configuring the right application in Zitadel to a ready application with integrated Login.

After completing the Step-By-Step Guide you will have:
1. Example Mobile App with integrated Zitadel Login
2. Example page accessible by authenticated user
3. Correct setup for your application in Zitadel
