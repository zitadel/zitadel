import NewFeature from './_new-feature.mdx';

An initial version of our Software Development Kit (SDK) will be published.
To better align our versioning with the [ZITADEL core](#zitadel-core), the SDK will be released as version 3.x.
This strategic versioning will ensure a more consistent and intuitive development experience across our entire ecosystem.

        <summary>Service Account Authentication Methods</summary>

        This feature introduces robust and standardized authentication methods for your service accounts, enabling secure automated access to your resources.

        Choose from the following authentication methods:
        - **Private Key JWT Authentication**: Enhance security by using asymmetric cryptography. A client with a registered public key can generate and sign a JSON Web Token (JWT) with its private key to authenticate.
        - **Client Credentials Grant**: A simple and direct method for machine-to-machine authentication where the client confidentially provides its credentials to the authorization server in exchange for an access token.
        - **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**: Ideal for individual developers or specific scripts, PATs offer a convenient way to create long-lived, revocable tokens with specific scopes, acting as a substitute for a password.

        <summary>Zitadel APIs Wrapper</summary>

        This SDK provides a convenient client for interacting with the ZITADEL APIs, simplifying how you manage resources within your instance.

        Currently, the client is tailored for machine-to-machine communication, enabling service accounts to authenticate and manage ZITADEL resources programmatically.
        Please note that this initial version is focused on API calls for automated tasks and does not yet include support for user authentication flows like OAuth or OIDC.
