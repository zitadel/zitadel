This page lists the infrastructure versions that ZITADEL is tested against and officially supports.

## Database

ZITADEL requires a PostgreSQL database. Versions **14 to 18** are supported.

See the [Database](/self-hosting/manage/database) page for full configuration options, how to pre-create users and databases, and how to rotate credentials.

## Cache (optional)

ZITADEL supports Redis as an optional cache to speed up lookups of frequently needed objects.
Redis must run in **standalone mode** (Cluster and Sentinel are not yet supported).

See the [Caches](/self-hosting/manage/cache) page for configuration options.

## Container runtime

- **Docker Compose**: v2.x (Compose V1 `docker-compose` CLI is not supported)
- **Kubernetes**: see the [Kubernetes deployment guide](/self-hosting/deploy/kubernetes)

## Reverse proxy

Any reverse proxy that supports HTTP/2 upstream connections (h2c or h2) works with ZITADEL.
The following proxies are tested and have dedicated configuration guides:

- **Traefik**: v3.x
- **NGINX**: v1.x stable releases
- **Caddy**: v2.x
- **Apache httpd**: 2.4.x

See the [Reverse Proxy Configuration](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/reverse_proxy) page for details and Docker Compose examples.
