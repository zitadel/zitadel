# Database Configuration

<Callout type="info">
Even if you provision the PostgreSQL user and database manually, you must still run `zitadel init schema`
to bootstrap the required schemas and tables before running `start-from-setup` or `zitadel start`.
Skipping this step causes `relation "eventstore.events" does not exist` errors.
See the [Managed PostgreSQL / No Admin Access](#managed-postgresql--no-admin-access) section below for the exact steps.

The command is `zitadel init schema` (alias: `zitadel init zitadel` for backwards compatibility).
</Callout>

## ZITADEL with Postgres

PostgreSQL is the default database for ZITADEL due to its reliability, robustness, and adherence to SQL standards. It is well-suited for handling the complex data requirements of an identity management system.

If you are using Zitadel v2 and want to use a PostgreSQL database, you can [overwrite the default configuration](/self-hosting/manage/configure/configure).

Currently, versions 14 to 18 are supported.

Postgres can be configured as follows:
```yaml
Database:
  postgres:
    Host: localhost
    Port: 5432
    Database: zitadel
    AwaitInitialConn: 5m
    MaxOpenConns: 15
    MaxIdleConns: 10
    MaxConnLifetime: 1h
    MaxConnIdleTime: 5m
    Options:
    User:
      Username: zitadel
      Password: zitadel
      SSL:
        Mode: disable  # Use 'require' or 'verify-full' for production
        RootCert:
        Cert:
        Key:
    Admin:
      Username: postgres
      Password: postgres
      SSL:
        Mode: disable  # Use 'require' or 'verify-full' for production
        RootCert:
        Cert:
        Key:
```

### Managed PostgreSQL / No Admin Access

If you don't have a PostgreSQL superuser available (e.g. managed services like RDS, Cloud SQL, or Azure Database),
you can pre-provision the user and database yourself and skip the admin-credential requirement.

The `init` command performs two steps that require different privileges:

- **Provisioning step** — `CREATE ROLE`, `CREATE DATABASE`, `GRANT` → requires a superuser/admin.
- **Schema bootstrapping step** — creates schemas (`eventstore`, `projections`, `system`) and tables → requires only database owner privileges.

If you handle the provisioning step manually, you still **must** run the schema bootstrapping step. Use the dedicated sub-command `zitadel init schema`, which performs only schema bootstrapping using the service user credentials — no admin privileges needed.

**Provisioning step — Provision user and database (run as superuser)**

:::caution
Replace `<strong-password>` with a strong, unique password and store it in a secret manager. Do not use trivial passwords in production.
:::

```sql
CREATE ROLE zitadel LOGIN PASSWORD '<strong-password>';
CREATE DATABASE zitadel WITH OWNER zitadel;
-- The GRANT below is redundant when zitadel is the database owner,
-- but is included for clarity. Owners implicitly hold all privileges.
GRANT CONNECT, CREATE ON DATABASE zitadel TO zitadel;
```

Adjust `pg_hba.conf` if needed to allow the zitadel user to connect.

**Schema bootstrapping step — Bootstrap schemas and tables (run as the service user)**

Set only the service user credentials — no `Admin.*` variables are needed for this command.

For managed/remote PostgreSQL, set `SSL_MODE` to `require` or `verify-full` to encrypt the connection. `disable` is only appropriate for local development.

```bash
ZITADEL_DATABASE_POSTGRES_HOST=<your-host> \
    ZITADEL_DATABASE_POSTGRES_PORT=5432 \
    ZITADEL_DATABASE_POSTGRES_DATABASE=zitadel \
    ZITADEL_DATABASE_POSTGRES_USER_USERNAME=zitadel \
    ZITADEL_DATABASE_POSTGRES_USER_PASSWORD=<strong-password> \
    ZITADEL_DATABASE_POSTGRES_USER_SSL_MODE=require \
    zitadel init schema
```

**Run setup and start**

:::note
For production deployments, configure TLS to encrypt authentication traffic. See the [TLS configuration guide](/self-hosting/manage/tls_modes) for the available modes.
:::

```bash
zitadel start-from-setup --masterkey "<32-character-key>"
```

See the [phases guide](/self-hosting/manage/updating_scaling#separating-init-and-setup-from-the-runtime) for details on separating init, setup, and runtime for production deployments.

## Zitadel Credentials

The [init phase](/self-hosting/manage/updating_scaling#separating-init-and-setup-from-the-runtime) of ZITADEL creates the ZITADEL database user (`Database.*.User.Username` & `Database.*.User.Password`) if it does not exist and admin credentials are provided. **Init does not update or deprecate existing users or passwords.** If you need to change the ZITADEL database user or rotate its password, you must do this manually.

<Callout type="warn">
The `init` command is designed to be run **only once**, during the initial setup of ZITADEL. Running `init` again after changing the database user or credentials does **not** migrate database object ownerships, nor does it reassign permissions on schemas, tables, or other objects to a new user. You must update these permissions manually if you switch users.
</Callout>

### Rotating Database Credentials

If you must rotate the credentials:

- You can change the password for the existing ZITADEL user, but you must manually update the password wherever ZITADEL needs it.
- Creating a new database user requires manual reassignment of ownership and privileges for all required database objects (schemas, tables, etc.) to the new user.
- After migration, remove or deprecate the old user using admin access and commands appropriate for your database provider.

Attempting to run `init` a second time with new credentials will fail if the user already exists, and will not change existing permissions or migrate data.

<Callout type="warn">
Dropping and recreating the database does **not** automatically remove existing users. Always verify and clean up old users if necessary.
</Callout>
