title: Reverse Proxy Configuration
description: "Setup and configure reverse proxies like Traefik, NGINX, and Caddy to manage external traffic for self-hosted ZITADEL."
---

ZITADEL exposes a single HTTP/2 port (default `8080`) that serves both gRPC and HTTP APIs, as well as the management console.
Running a reverse proxy in front of ZITADEL is the recommended approach for production deployments because it:

- Terminates TLS and provides HTTPS to clients
- Exposes standard ports (`80`/`443`) while keeping ZITADEL on an internal port
- Handles certificate renewal (e.g. via Let's Encrypt)
- Enables path-based routing between the ZITADEL API and the Login UI

## HTTP/2 and h2c requirements

ZITADEL relies on HTTP/2 for all gRPC communication.
When the reverse proxy terminates TLS, it must forward traffic to ZITADEL using **h2c** (unencrypted HTTP/2), not HTTP/1.1.
Not all reverse proxies support h2c by default — check the proxy-specific guides below for configuration examples.

For more details, see [HTTP/2 Support in ZITADEL](/self-hosting/manage/http2).

## TLS modes

ZITADEL supports three TLS modes that affect how the reverse proxy should be configured:

| Mode | Description | Typical use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `disabled` | ZITADEL listens on plain HTTP, reverse proxy handles nothing special | Local development, h2c passthrough |
| `external` | ZITADEL listens on plain HTTP; reverse proxy terminates TLS | Most production setups |
| `enabled` | ZITADEL itself terminates TLS (end-to-end encryption) | Environments requiring mutual TLS |

For more details, see [TLS Modes](/self-hosting/manage/tls_modes).

## Proxy guides

Check out one of the following guides to configure your favourite reverse proxy:

- [NGINX](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/nginx)
- [Caddy](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/caddy)
- [Apache httpd](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/httpd)
- [Cloudflare](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/cloudflare)
- [Cloudflare Tunnel](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/cloudflare_tunnel)
- [Fronting Zitadel Cloud](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/zitadel_cloud)

## Login UI routing

When running both the ZITADEL API and the Login V2 UI (`zitadel-login`) behind a reverse proxy, the proxy must route traffic to the correct upstream:

- `/ui/v2/login` → Login UI container (port `3000` by default)
- All other paths → ZITADEL API container (port `8080` by default)

The proxy-specific guides include Docker Compose examples that demonstrate this split routing.

For tested proxy versions, see [ZITADEL Requirements](/self-hosting/manage/requirements#reverse-proxy).
