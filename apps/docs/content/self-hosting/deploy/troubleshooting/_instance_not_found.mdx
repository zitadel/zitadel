If you're self-hosting with a Custom Domain, you need to instruct ZITADEL to use the `ExternalDomain`.
You can find further instructions in our guide about [Custom Domains](/self-hosting/manage/custom-domain).
We also provide a guide on how to [configure](/self-hosting/manage/configure) ZITADEL with variables from files or environment variables.
