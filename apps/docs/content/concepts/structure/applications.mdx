import AppType from "../../guides/manage/console/_application-types.mdx";

Applications are the entry point to your project.
[Users](./users) either login into one of your clients and interact with them directly or use one of your APIs.
All applications share the roles and authorizations of their [project](./projects).

## Supported application types

ZITADEL supports the following client types:

<AppType components={props.components} />

## Security considerations

Ensure the configuration of application settings is limited to authorized users only.

You can configure applications in the [management console](/guides/manage/console/organizations-overview).
Read about our [managers](/concepts/structure/managers) and [granted projects](/concepts/structure/granted_projects)
concepts.
