Managers are [human users or service users](/guides/manage/console/users-overview) who have permission to manage resources within ZITADEL.

Manager permissions can be assigned to different levels in ZITADEL:

- **IAM Managers**: This is the highest level. Users with IAM Administrator roles are able to manage the whole [Instance](/concepts/structure/instance).
- **Org Managers**: Managers in the Organization Level are able to view or manage everything, according to their permissions, within the granted [Organization](/guides/manage/console/organizations-overview).
- **Project Mangers**: In this level the user is able to manage a [project](/guides/manage/console/projects-overview).
- **Project Grant Manager**: The project grant manager is for [granted projects](/concepts/structure/granted_projects) by another organization. main:docs/docs/concepts/structure/_manager_description.mdx

The scope of the managers is restricted based on their level.
Which means that a Manager, assigned to one organization, will have access only to the resources and configurations of that organization.
Only the Managers on the instance level can view resources, such as users, across all organizations.
