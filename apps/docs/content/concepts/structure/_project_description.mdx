The idea of projects is to have a vessel for all components who are closely related to each other. Multiple projects can exist within an organization.

All applications within a project share the same roles, grants, and role assignments:

- **Applications** initiate the authorization flow. They could be a web application and a mobile application that share the same roles.
- **Roles** define the access rights of a project and can be assigned to users.
- **Role Assignments** define the association between users and their roles within a project.
- **Granted Organizations** are organizations that have been granted access to a project in a different organization, allowing them to manage user role assignments for that project.
