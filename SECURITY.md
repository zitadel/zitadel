  * potential security vulnerability in `ZITADEL`

## Security Vulnerability Response

TBD

## Public Disclosure

All accepted and mitigated vulnerabilities will be published on [ZITADEL's GitHub Security Page](https://github.com/caos/zitadel/security/advisories).

### Timing

We think it is crucial to publish advisories `ASAP` as mitigations are ready. But due to the unknown nature of the discloures the time frame can range from 7 to 90 days.
