## AGPL-3.0-only Compliance

ZITADEL is open-source software intended for community use. Determining your application's compliance with the AGPL-3.0-only license is your responsibility.

**We strongly recommend consulting with legal counsel or licensing specialists to ensure your usage of ZITADEL, and any other integrated open-source projects, adheres to their respective licenses. AGPL-3.0-only compliance can be complex.**

If your application triggers AGPL-3.0-only obligations and you wish to avoid them (e.g., you do not plan to open-source your modifications or application), please [contact us](https://zitadel.com/contact) to discuss commercial licensing options. Using ZITADEL without verifying your license compliance is at your own risk.
