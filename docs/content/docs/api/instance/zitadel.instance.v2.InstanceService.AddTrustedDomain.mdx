          Add Trusted Domain

           Adds a trusted domain to the instance.
           By default the instance will be determined by the context of the request,
           e.g. the host header.
           You can optionally pass an InstanceID to list the domains of a specific instance.
           This requires additional permissions.

           It must be a valid domain name.
           Once the domain is added, it can be used in API responses like OIDC discovery,
           email templates, and more.
           This can be used in cases where the API is accessed through a different domain
           than the instance domain, e.g. proxy setups and custom login UIs.
           Unlike custom domain, trusted domains are not used to route requests to this instance
           and therefore do not need to be uniquely assigned to an instance.

           Required permissions:
            - `iam.write`
            - `system.instance.write` (if InstanceID is set)
