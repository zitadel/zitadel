Once you created the provider, it is listed in the providers overview.
Activate it by selecting the tick with the tooltip *set as available*.

If you deactivate a provider, your users with links to it will not be able to authenticate anymore.
You can reactivate it and the logins will work again.

The provider can also be activated via API. As the identity providers are sub-resources of the login settings, this is done by linking the provider to the settings:
- [Activate Default Identity Provider](/docs/reference/api-v1/admin/zitadel.admin.v1.AdminService.AddIDPToLoginPolicy)
- [Activate Organization Identity Provider](/docs/reference/api-v1/management/zitadel.management.v1.ManagementService.AddIDPToLoginPolicy)
