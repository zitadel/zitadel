If you're self hosting with a custom domain, you need to instruct ZITADEL to use the `ExternalDomain`.
You can find further instructions in our guide about [custom domains](/docs/operate/configure/custom-domain).
We also provide a guide on how to [configure](/docs/operate/configure/configure) ZITADEL with variables from files or environment variables.
