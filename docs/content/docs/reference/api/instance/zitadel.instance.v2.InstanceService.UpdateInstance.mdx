          Update Instance

           Updates instance's name in the current context or by its ID.
           By default the instance will be determined by the context of the request,
           e.g. the host header.
           You can optionally pass an InstanceID to update a specific instance.
           This requires additional permissions.

           Required permissions:
             - `iam.write`
             - `system.instance.write` (if InstanceID is set)
