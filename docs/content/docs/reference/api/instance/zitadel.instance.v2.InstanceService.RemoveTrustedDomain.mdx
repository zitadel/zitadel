          Remove Trusted Domain

           Removes a trusted domain from the instance.
           By default the instance will be determined by the context of the request,
           e.g. the host header.
           You can optionally pass an InstanceID to list the domains of a specific instance.
           This requires additional permissions.

           Required permissions:
            - `iam.write`
            - `system.instance.write` (if InstanceID is set)
