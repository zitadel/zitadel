           Terminate an existing session. This invalidates the session and its token.
           The session can no longer be used for the authentication of other resources
           or to authenticate against the ZITADEL APIs.

           You can only terminate your own session, unless you are granted the `session.delete` permission.

           Required permissions:
             - `session.delete`
             - no permission required for own sessions or when providing the current session token
