          Get Hosted Login Translation

           Returns the translations in the requested locale for the hosted login.
           The translations returned are based on the input level specified (system, instance or organization).

           If the requested level doesn't contain all translations, and ignore_inheritance is set to false,
           a merging process fallbacks onto the higher levels ensuring all keys in the file have a translation,
           which could be in the default language if the one of the locale is missing on all levels.

           The etag returned in the response represents the hash of the translations as they are stored on DB
           and its reliable only if ignore_inheritance = true.

           Required permissions:
             - `iam.policy.read`
