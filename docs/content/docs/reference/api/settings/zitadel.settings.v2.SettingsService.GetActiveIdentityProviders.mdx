          Get Active Identity Providers

           Get the current active identity providers for the requested context.
           This can be the instance or an organization. In case of an organization,
           the returned identity providers will fall back to the active instance identity providers
           if not explicitly set on the organization.

           Optionally, filter the identity providers by their allowed actions:
             - creation_allowed: only return identity providers that are allowed for user creation
             - linking_allowed: only return identity providers that are allowed for linking to existing users
             - auto_creation: only return identity providers that are allowed for automatic user creation
             - auto_linking: only return identity providers that are allowed for automatic linking to existing users

           Required permissions:
             - `policy.read`
