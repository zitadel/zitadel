          Activate Web Key

           Switch the active signing web key. The previously active key will be deactivated.
           Note that the JWKs OIDC endpoint returns a cacheable response.
           Therefore it is not advised to activate a key that has been created within the cache duration (default is 5min),
           as the public key may not have been propagated to caches and clients yet.

           Required permission:
             - `iam.web_key.write`
