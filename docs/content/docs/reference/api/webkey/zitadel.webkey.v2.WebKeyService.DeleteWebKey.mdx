          Delete Web Key

           Delete a web key pair. Only inactive keys can be deleted. Once a key is deleted,
           any tokens signed by this key will be invalid.
           Note that the JWKs OIDC endpoint returns a cacheable response.
           In case the web key is not found, the request will return a successful response as
           the desired state is already achieved.
           You can check the change date in the response to verify if the web key was deleted during the request.

           Required permission:
             - `iam.web_key.delete`
