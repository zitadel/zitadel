          Resend an invite code for a user

           Deprecated: Use [CreateInviteCode](/docs/reference/api/user/zitadel.user.v2.UserService.CreateInviteCode) instead.

           Resend an invite code for a user to initialize their first authentication method (password, passkeys, IdP) depending on the organization's available methods.
           A resend is only possible if a code has been created previously and sent to the user. If there is no code or it was directly returned, an error will be returned.
