          Create Administrator

           CreateAdministrator grants an administrator role to a user for a specific resource.

           Note that the roles are specific to the resource type.
           This means that if you want to grant a user the administrator role for an organization and a project,
           you need to create two administrator roles.

           Required permissions depend on the resource type:
             - "iam.member.write" for instance administrators
             - "org.member.write" for organization administrators
             - "project.member.write" for project administrators
             - "project.grant.member.write" for project grant administrators
