          Deactivate User

           Deprecated: use [user service v2 DeactivateUser](/docs/reference/api/user/zitadel.user.v2.UserService.DeactivateUser) instead.

           The state of the user will be changed to 'deactivated'. The user will not be able to log in anymore.
           The endpoint returns an error if the user is already in the state 'deactivated'.
           Use deactivate user when the user should not be able to use the account anymore, but you still need access to the user data.
