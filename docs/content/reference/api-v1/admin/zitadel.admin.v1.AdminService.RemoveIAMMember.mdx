          Remove IAM Member

           Deprecated: use [DeleteAdministrator](/docs/reference/api/internal_permission/zitadel.internal_permission.v2.InternalPermissionService.DeleteAdministrator) instead.

           Members are users with permission to administrate ZITADEL on different levels. This request removes a user from the members list on an instance level. The user can still have roles on another level (organization, project).
