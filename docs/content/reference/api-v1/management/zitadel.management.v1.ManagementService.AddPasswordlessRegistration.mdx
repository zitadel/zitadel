          Add Passwordless/Passkey Registration Link

           Deprecated: use [user service v2 RegisterPasskey](/docs/reference/api/user/zitadel.user.v2.UserService.RegisterPasskey) instead.

           Adds a new passwordless/passkey authenticator link to the user and returns it in the response. The link enables the user to register a new device if current passwordless/passkey devices are all platform authenticators. e.g. User has already registered Windows Hello and wants to register FaceID on the iPhone.
