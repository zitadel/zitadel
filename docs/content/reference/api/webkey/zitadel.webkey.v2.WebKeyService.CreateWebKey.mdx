          Create Web Key

           Generate a private and public key pair. The private key can be used to sign OIDC tokens after activation.
           The public key can be used to validate OIDC tokens.
           The newly created key will have the state `STATE_INITIAL` and is published to the public key endpoint.
           Note that the JWKs OIDC endpoint returns a cacheable response.

           If no key type is provided, a RSA key pair with 2048 bits and SHA256 hashing will be created.

           Required permission:
             - `iam.web_key.write`
