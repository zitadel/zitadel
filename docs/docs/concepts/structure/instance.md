An instance is the top hierarchy in the ZITADEL.
Within an instance all the default [settings](./policies), such as branding, login policy, password policy, etc. for the system can be configured.
One instance normally runs on one domain and has one issuer. (e.g login.customer.com)

One instance can contain multiple [organizations](./organizations). Which can represent the own company or the customers.
