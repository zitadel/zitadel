Managers are [human users or service users](/docs/guides/manage/console/users-overview) who have permission to manage resources within ZITADEL.

Manager permissions can be assigned to different levels in ZITADEL:

- **IAM Managers**: This is the highest level. Users with IAM Manager roles are able to manage the whole [Instance](/docs/concepts/structure/instance).
- **Org Managers**: Managers in the Organization Level are able to view or manage everything, according to their permissions, within the granted [Organization](/docs/guides/manage/console/organizations-overview).
- **Project Mangers**: In this level the user is able to manage a [project](/docs/guides/manage/console/projects-overview).
- **Project Grant Manager**: The project grant manager is for [granted projects](/docs/concepts/structure/granted_projects) by another organization.

Scope of the managers is restricted based on their level.
That means a Manager, assigned to one organization, will only get access to resources and configurations of that organization.
Only Managers on the instance level can view resources, such as users, across all organizations.
