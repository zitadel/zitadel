By using ZITADEL actions V2, you can manipulate ZITADELs behavior on specific API calls, events or functions.
This is useful when you have special business requirements that ZITADEL doesn't support out-of-the-box.

We're working on Actions continuously. In the [roadmap](https://zitadel.com/roadmap), you see how we are planning to expand and improve it. Please tell us about your needs and help us prioritize further fixes and features.

## Why actions?
ZITADEL can't anticipate and solve every possible business rule and integration requirements from all ZITADEL users. Here are some examples:
- A business requires domain specific data validation before a user can be created or authenticated.
- A business needs to automate tasks. Roles should be assigned to users based on their ADFS 2016+ groups.
- A business needs to store metadata on a user that is used for integrating applications.
- A business needs to restrict the users who are allowed to register to a certain organization by their email domains.

With actions, ZITADEL provides a way to solve such problems.

## How it works
There are 3 components necessary:
- Endpoint, an external endpoint with the desired logic, can be whatever is necessary as long as it can receive an HTTP Post request.
- Target, a resource in ZITADEL with all necessary information how to trigger an endpoint
- Execution, a resource in ZITADEL with the information when to trigger which targets

The process is that ZITADEL decides at certain points that with a defined Execution a call to the defined Target(s) is triggered, 
so that everybody can implement their custom behaviour for as many processes as possible.

Possible conditions for the Execution:
- Request, to react to or manipulate requests to ZITADEL, for example add information to newly created users
- Response, to react to or manipulate responses to ZITADEL, for example to provision newly created users to other systems
- Function, to react to different functionality in ZITADEL, replaces [Actions](/concepts/features/actions)
- Event, to create to different events which get created in ZITADEL, for example to inform somebody if a user gets locked
