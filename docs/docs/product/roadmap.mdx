    <details>
        <summary>Actions V2</summary>

        Zitadel Actions V2 empowers you to customize Zitadel's workflows by executing your own logic at specific points. You define external Endpoints containing your code and configure Targets and Executions within Zitadel to trigger them based on various conditions and events.

        Why we built it: To provide greater flexibility and control, allowing you to implement custom business rules, automate tasks, enrich user data, control access, and integrate with other systems seamlessly. Actions V2 enables you to tailor Zitadel precisely to your unique needs.

    <details>
        <summary>License Change Apache 2.0 to AGPL3</summary>

        Zitadel is switching to the AGPL 3.0 license to ensure the project's sustainability and encourage community contributions from commercial users, while keeping the core free and open source.

    <BreakingChanges/>

    <details>
        <summary>CockroachDB Support removed</summary>

        After careful consideration, we have made the decision to discontinue support for CockroachDB in Zitadel v3 and beyond.
        While CockroachDB is an excellent distributed SQL database, supporting multiple database backends has increased our maintenance burden and complicated our testing matrix.
        Check out our [migration guide](https://zitadel.com/docs/self-hosting/manage/cli/mirror) to migrate from CockroachDB to PostgreSQL.

        More details can be found [here](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/9414)
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Actions API v3 alpha removed</summary>

        With the current release we have published the Actions V2 API as a beta version, and got rid of the previously published alpha API.
        Check out the [new API](http://localhost:3000/docs/apis/resources/action_service_v2)

        <summary>SCIM 2.0 Server - User Resource</summary>

        The Zitadel SCIM v2 service provider interface enables seamless integration of identity and access management (IAM) systems with Zitadel, following the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 specification.
        This interface allows standardized management of IAM resources, making it easier to automate user provisioning and deprovisioning.

    <details>
        <summary>Token Exchange (Impersonation)</summary>

        The Token Exchange grant implements [RFC 8693, OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693) and can be used to exchange tokens to a different scope, audience or subject.
        Changing the subject of an authenticated token is called impersonation or delegation.

    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Caches</summary>

        ZITADEL supports the use of a caches to speed up the lookup of frequently needed objects.
        As opposed to HTTP caches which might reside between ZITADEL and end-user applications, the cache build into ZITADEL uses active invalidation when an object gets updated.
        Another difference is that HTTP caches only cache the result of a complete request and the built-in cache stores objects needed for the internal business logic.
        For example, each request made to ZITADEL needs to retrieve and set instance information in middleware.

    <summary>New Features</summary>

    <NewFeature/>

    <details>
        <summary>Analytics</summary>

        We provide comprehensive and insightful analytics capabilities that empower you with the information needed to understand platform usage, monitor system health, and make data-driven decisions.

        <details>
            <summary>Daily Active Users (DAU) & Monthly Active Users (MAU)</summary>

            Administrators need to track user activity to understand platform usage and identify trends.
            This feature provides basic metrics for daily and monthly active users, allowing for filtering by date range and scope (instance-wide or within a specific organization).
            The metrics should ensure that each user is counted only once per day or month, respectively, regardless of how many actions they performed.
            This minimal feature serves as a foundation for future expansion into more detailed analytics.

            For more details track our [github issue](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/7506).
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Resource Count Metrics</summary>

            To effectively manage a Zitadel instance, administrators need to understand resource utilization.
            This feature provides metrics for resource counts, including organizations, users (with filtering options), projects, applications, and authorizations.
            For users, we will offer filters to retrieve the total count, counts per organization, and counts by user type (human or machine).
            These metrics will provide administrators with valuable insights into the scale and complexity of their Zitadel instance.


            For more details track our [github issue](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/9709).
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Operational Metrics</summary>

            To empower customers to better manage and optimize their Zitadel instances, we will provide access to detailed operational metrics.
            This data will help customers identify potential issues, optimize performance, and ensure the stability of their deployments.
            The provided data will encompass basic system information, infrastructure details, configuration settings, error reports, and the health status of various Zitadel components, accessible via a user interface or an API.


            For more details track our [github issue](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/9476).

        </details>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>User Groups</summary>

        Administrators will be able to define groups within an organization and assign users to these groups.
        More details about the feature can be found [here](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/9702)
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Basic Thread Detection Framework</summary>

        ...
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>User Uniqueness on Organization Level</summary>

        Administrators will be able to define weather users should be unique across the instance or within an organization.
        This allows managing users independently and avoids conflicts due to shared user identifiers.
        Example: The user with the username user@gmail.com can be created in the Organization "Customer A" and "Customer B" if uniqueness is defined on the organization level.

        Stay updated on the progress and details on our [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/9535)
    </details>


    <details>
        <summary>Remove Required Fields</summary>

        Currently, the user creation process requires several fields, such as email, first name, and last name, which can be restrictive in certain scenarios. This feature allows administrators to create users with only a username, making other fields optional.
        This provides flexibility for systems that don't require complete user profiles upon initial creation for example simplified onboarding flows.

        <summary>SCIM 2.0 Server - User Resource</summary>
        [SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)](https://scim.cloud/) is a standard that allows the exchange of user identity information between different systems, such as when a new employee is onboarded and needs to be provisioned  to various applications.
        For more detailed information read the section about the [User Resource Schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-4.1) in the [RFC7643](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643).
        The implementation is compliant with the standard  and includes all requests for the user resource and the discovery endpoints.
        Read the full description of the API in our [SCIM API Docs](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/scim2) or our guide about [managing users with SCIM 2.0](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/user/scim2).

### Future Vision / Upcoming Features

#### Fine Grained Authorization

We're planning the future of Zitadel and fine-grained authorization is high on our list.
While Zitadel already offers strong role-based access (RBAC), we know many of you need more granular control.

**What is Fine-Grained Authorization?**

It's about moving beyond broad roles to define precise access based on:

- Attributes (ABAC): User details (department, location), resource characteristics (sensitivity), or context (time of day).
- Relationships (ReBAC): Connections between users and resources (e.g., "owner" of a document, "manager" of a team).
- Policies (PBAC): Explicit rules combining attributes and relationships.

**Why Explore This?**

Fine-grained authorization can offer:
- Tighter Security: Minimize access to only what's essential.
- Greater Flexibility: Adapt to complex and dynamic business rules.
- Easier Compliance: Meet strict regulatory demands.
- Scalable Permissions: Manage access effectively as you grow.

**We Need Your Input!** 🗣️

As we explore the best way to bring this to Zitadel, tell us:
- Your Use Cases: Where do you need more detailed access control than standard roles provide?
- Preferred Models: Are you thinking attribute-based, relationship-based, or something else?
- Integration Preferences:
    - A fully integrated solution within Zitadel?
    - Or integration with existing authorization vendors (e.g. openFGA, cerbos, etc.)?

Your feedback is crucial for shaping our roadmap.

#### Thread Detection

We're taking the next step in securing your applications by exploring a new Threat Detection framework for Zitadel.
Our goal is to proactively identify and stop malicious activity in real-time.

**Our First Step: A Modern reCAPTCHA Alternative**
We will begin by building a system to detect and mitigate malicious bots, serving as a smart, privacy-focused alternative to CAPTCHA.
This initial use case will help us combat credential stuffing, spam registrations, and other automated attacks, forming the foundation of our larger framework.

**How We Envision It**

Our exploration is focused on creating an intelligent system that:
- **Analyzes Signals**: Gathers data points like IP reputation, device characteristics, and user behavior to spot suspicious activity.
- **Uses AI/**: Trains models to distinguish between legitimate users and bots, reducing friction for real users.
- **Mitigates Threats**: Enables flexible responses when a threat is detected, such as blocking the attempt, requiring MFA, or sending an alert.

**Help Us Shape the Future** 🤝

As we design this framework, we need to know:
- What are your biggest security threats today?
- What kind of automated responses (e.g., block, notification) would be most useful for you?
- What are your key privacy or compliance concerns regarding threat detection?

Your feedback will directly influence our development and ensure we build a solution that truly meets your needs.

#### The Role of AI in Zitadel

As we look to the future, we believe Artificial Intelligence will be a critical tool for enhancing both user experience and security within Zitadel.
Our vision for AI is focused on two key areas: providing intelligent, contextual assistance and building a collective defense against emerging threats.

1. **AI-Powered Support**

We want you to get fast, accurate answers to your questions without ever having to leave your workflow.
To achieve this, we are integrating an AI-powered support assistant trained on our knowledge base, including our documentation, tutorials, and community discussions.

Our rollout is planned in phases to ensure we deliver a helpful experience:
- **Phase 1 (Happening Now)**: We are currently testing a preliminary version of our AI bot within our [community channels](https://discord.com/channels/927474939156643850/1357076488825995477). This allows us to gather real-world questions and answers, refining the AI's accuracy and helpfulness based on direct feedback.
- **Phase 2 (Next Steps)**: Once we are confident in its capabilities, we will integrate this AI assistant directly into our documentation. You'll be able to ask complex questions and get immediate, well-sourced answers.
- **Phase 3 (The Ultimate Goal)**: The final step is to embed the assistant directly into the Zitadel Console/Customer Portal. Imagine getting help based on the exact context of what you're doing—whether you're configuring an action, setting up a new organization, or integrating social login.

2. **Decentralized AI for Threat Detection**

Security threats are constantly evolving.
A threat vector that targets one customer today might target another tomorrow.
We believe in the power of collective intelligence to provide proactive security for everyone.

This leads to our second major AI initiative: **decentralized model training** for our Threat Detection framework.

Here’s how it would work:
- **Collective Data, Anonymously**: Customers across our cloud and self-hosted environments experience different user behaviors and threat vectors. We plan to offer an opt-in system where anonymized, non-sensitive data (like behavioral patterns and threat signals) can be collected from participating instances.
- **Centralized Training**: This collective, anonymized data will be used to train powerful, next-generation AI security models. With a much larger and more diverse dataset, these models can learn to identify subtle and emerging threats far more effectively than a model trained on a single instance's data.
- **Shared Protection**: These constantly improving models would then be distributed to all participating Zitadel instances.

The result is a powerful security network effect. You could receive protection from a threat vector you haven't even experienced yet, simply because the system learned from an attack on another member of the community.
