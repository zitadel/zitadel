This guide shows how to login users and assign roles with [Workforce Identity Federation to Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation).

It covers how to:

- create and configure your application in ZITADEL
- configure an Action to transform claims
- create and configure the connection to Google Cloud with Workforce Identity Federation using OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Prerequisites:

- existing ZITADEL Instance, if not present follow [this guide](/guides/start/quickstart)
- existing ZITADEL Organization, if not present follow [this guide](/guides/manage/console/organizations)
- existing ZITADEL project, if not present follow the first 3 steps [here](/guides/manage/console/projects)
- prerequisites on Google Cloud side [in the configuration guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation).

> We have to switch between ZITADEL and a Google Cloud. If the headings begin with "ZITADEL" switch to the ZITADEL Console and if
> the headings start with "Google Cloud" please refer to the configuration guide on Google Cloud.

## **Google Cloud**: Configure

Follow the steps **Before you begin**,  **Required roles**, and **create a workforce identity pool** (OIDC) in the [in the configuration guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation).

Before you create the workforce identity pool provider you should create your application in ZITADEL.

## **ZITADEL**: Create the application

In your existing project:

First of all we create the application in your project.

:::info
Google Cloud requires just an ID Token as JWT including the [described required and optional scopes](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-mappings).
:::

Create a new application and click on "I'm a pro. Skip this wizard."

- **Application Type**: Web
- **Grant Types**: Implicit
- **Response Type**: ID Token
- **Authentication Method**: None

:::info
You need to add the redirect URL and configure token settings after creating the application.
:::

## **ZITADEL**: Redirect url

![Redirect URL](/img/guides/integrate/services/google-cloud-redirect-url.png)

After creating, go to the application settings "Redirect settings" and add the redirect url from Googles configuration guide. 
It looks something like `https://auth.cloud.google/signin-callback/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID`.

Save the settings.

:::caution
Make sure to replace the `WORKFORCE_POOL_ID` and `WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID` with your values in the redirect url
:::

## **ZITADEL**: Token settings

![Token settings](/img/guides/integrate/services/google-cloud-token-settings.png)

After creating, go to the application settings "Token settings" and configure as follows:

- **Auth Token Type**: JWT
- **Add user roles to the access token**: disabled (optional)
- **User roles inside ID Token**: enabled
- **User Info inside ID Token**: enabled

Save the settings.

## **ZITADEL**: Custom claims

Go to your project and create roles according to the Groups in Google Cloud.
Authorize a test user by assigning roles in ZITADEL.

Google Cloud expects some claims, including groups, in a specific format as [described here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-mappings).
Claims can be transformed in ZITADEL with [Actions](/apis/actions/introduction).

Create an Action with the following code to flatten the roles and include the claim for the users' display name.

:::info
If you want to configure a special attribute mapping in the workforce identity pool provider, then adjust the claims accordingly.
:::

```javascript
function googleGroups(ctx, api) {
  if (ctx.v1.user.grants == undefined || ctx.v1.user.grants.count == 0) {
    return;
  }

  let grants = [];
  ctx.v1.user.grants.grants.forEach(claim => {
    claim.roles.forEach(role => {
        grants.push(claim.projectId+':'+role)  
    })
  })

  api.v1.claims.setClaim('google.groups', grants)
  api.v1.claims.setClaim('google.display_name', ctx.v1.getUser().human.displayName)
}

```

![Action Code](/img/guides/integrate/services/google-cloud-action-code.png)



:::caution
Make sure that the name of the action matches the name of the function.
:::

And add the the Action Script to the following Flow and Trigger:

- **Flow Type**: Complement Token
- **Trigger Type**: Pre access token creation
- **Actions**: googleGroups

![Action Flow](/img/guides/integrate/services/google-cloud-action-flow.png)

## **Google Cloud**: Create a WIP provider

Complete the steps  in the [in the configuration guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation) with the `ISSUER_URI` and `CLIENT_ID` from ZITADEL.
