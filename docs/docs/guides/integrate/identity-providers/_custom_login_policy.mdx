The login policy can be configured on two levels. Once in the default settings and this can be overwritten for each organization.
The only difference is where you configure it. Go either to the settings page of a specific organization or to the default settings page.
Default Settings: $YOUR-DOMAIN/ui/console/instance?id=general
Organization: Choose the organization in the menu and go to $YOUR-DOMAIN/ui/console/org-settings?id=login

1. Go to the Settings
2. Modify your login policy in the menu "Login Behavior and Security"
3. Enable the attribute "External IDP allowed"

You can also change the settings through the API directly either in the default settings or on a specific organization:
- [Update Default Login Settings](/docs/apis/resources/admin/admin-service-update-login-policy)
- [Update Organization Login Settings](/docs/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-update-custom-login-policy)
