By default, ZITADEL shows what you define in the default settings.
If you overwrite the default settings for an organization, you need to send the organization scope in your auth request.

The organization scope looks like this: `urn:zitadel:iam:org:id:{id}`.
You can [read more about the reserved scopes](/apis/openidoauth/scopes#reserved-scopes)
or [use the ZITADEL OIDC Playground](https://zitadel.com/playgrounds/oidc) to see what happens with the login when you send different scopes.
