When your user is done using your application and clicks on the logout button, you have to send a request to the terminate session endpoint.
[Terminate Session Documentation](/docs/apis/resources/session_service/session-service-delete-session)

Sessions can be terminated by either:
- the authenticated user
- a manager, who is granted `session.delete` (e.g. ORG_OWNER) on the authenticated users organisation
- providing the current session_token in the body.

Terminating a session means to delete it.
If you try to read or update the session afterward, you will get an error that the Session does not exist or was terminated.


### Request for authenticated users or managers

Make sure that the provided token is from the authenticated user, resp. the manager:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://$ZITADEL_DOMAIN/v2/sessions/218480890961985793 \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer '"$TOKEN"''\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Request with session token

Send the session token in the body of the request:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://$ZITADEL_DOMAIN/v2/sessions/218480890961985793 \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer '"$TOKEN"''\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "sessionToken": "blGKerGQPKv8jN21p6E9GB1B-vl6_EyKlvTd5UALu8-aQmjucgZxHSXJx3XMFTwT9_Y3VnbOo3gC_Q"
}'
```
