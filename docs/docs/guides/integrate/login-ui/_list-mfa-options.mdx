Your user has successfully authenticated, and now you ask them if they want to setup MFA to have a more secure account.
When the user starts the configuration, first you want to show them the possible methods.
You can either list it implicitly or call the settings service from ZITADEL to get what is configured on the login settings.

More detailed information about the API: [Get Login Settings Documentation](/apis/resources/settings_service_v2/settings-service-get-login-settings)

Request Example:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://$ZITADEL_DOMAIN/v2/settings/login \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer '"$TOKEN"''
```

Response Example:
The relevant part for the list is the second factor and multi-factor list.
