#### redirect_uri

Native clients might have to register multiple redirect_uris as operating system have different requirements.
Typically, you register a redirect_uri starting with a custom protocol, e.g. `ch.zitadel.app://callback`.
You're also allowed to use http://localhost, http://127.0.0.1 and http:[::1] without specifying a port: `http://locahost/callback`.

#### post creation actions

After the application creation, you might want to set additional options like `refresh_token` and `additional origins`.

If you want to request refresh_tokens and use them to renew the user's access_tokens without their interaction,
enable them in the OIDC Configuration section by ticking the checkbox.

When calling the userinfo_endpoint or any ZITADEL API, we will check if an origin header is sent. This is automatically done
by the user agent. If one is sent we will check if the origin is allowed for your application. By default, all computed
origins of the redirect_uri list are allowed.
So if your native app is built with a JavaScript base framework like ReactNative and you only specified redirect_uris
with a custom protocol, you will need to add the origin where the app is served from, e.g. `http://localhost:8100`.

### Additional parameters and customization

There are additional parameters and values you can provide to satisfy your use case and to customize the user's authentication flow.
Please check the [authorization_endpoint reference](/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#authorization_endpoint) in the OAuth / OIDC documentation.

## Callback

Regardless of a successful or error response from the authorization_endpoint, the authorization server will call your
callback endpoint you provided by the `redirect_uri`.

:::note
If the redirect_uri is not provided, was not registered or anything other prevents the auth server form returning the response to the client,
the error will be display directly to the user on the auth server.
:::

Upon successful authentication you'll be given a `code` and if provided the unmodified `state` parameter.
You will need this `code` in the token request.

If a parameter was missing, malformed or any other error occurred, your answer will contain an `error` stating the error type,
possibly an `error_description` providing some information about the error and its reason and the `state` parameter.
Check the [error response section](/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#error-response) in the authorization_endpoint reference.

## Token request

Next you will have to exchange the given `code` for the tokens. For this HTTP POST request (form-urlencoded) you will need to provide the following:

- code: the code that was issued from the authorization request
- grant_type: must be `authorization_code`
- redirect_uri: callback uri where the code was sent to. Must match exactly the redirect_uri of the authorization request

Depending on your authentication method you'll need additional headers and parameters:

Send your `client_id` and the previously generated string as `code_verifier` for us to recompute the `code_challenge` of the authorization request:

```curl
curl --request POST \
--url {your-domain}/oauth/v2/token \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data grant_type=authorization_code \
--data code=${code} \
--data redirect_uri=${redirect_uri} \
--data client_id=${client_id} \
--data code_verifier=${code_verifier}
```
