title: Integrate ZITADEL APIs into a Go Application
sidebar_label: Example Go
---

This integration guide shows you how to integrate **ZITADEL** into your Go application.
It demonstrates how to fetch some data from the ZITADEL management API.

> ℹ️ These examples and guides are based on our official [Go SDK](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go).
>
> The SDK is a convenient wrapper around our low-level [OIDC library](https://github.com/zitadel/oidc). For most use cases, using the helpers provided in our [Go SDK](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go) is the recommended approach for implementing authentication.

At the end of the guide you should have an application able to read the details of your organization.

> This documentation references our [CLI example](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/blob/next/example/client/cli/cli.go).

## Prerequisites

The client [SDK](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go) will handle all necessary OAuth 2.0 requests and send the required headers to the ZITADEL API using our [Go SDK](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go).
All that is required, is a service account with an Org Owner (or another role, depending on the needed api requests) role assigned and its key JSON.

However, we recommend you read the guide on [how to access ZITADEL API](/docs/guides/integrate/zitadel-apis/access-zitadel-apis)) and the associated guides for a basic knowledge of :
 - [Recommended Authorization Flows](/docs/guides/integrate/login/oidc/oauth-recommended-flows)
 - [Service Users](/docs/guides/integrate/service-users/authenticate-service-users)

> Be sure to have a valid key JSON and that its service account is either ORG_OWNER or at least ORG_OWNER_VIEWER before you continue with this guide.

## Go Setup

### Add Go SDK to your project

You need to add the SDK into Go Modules by:

```bash
go get -u github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/v3
```

### Create example client

Create a new go file with the content below. This will create a client and call its `GetMyOrg` function on the ManagementService.
The SDK will make sure you will have access to the API by retrieving a Bearer Token using JWT Profile with the provided scopes (`openid` and `urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:id:zitadel:aud`).

```go reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/blob/next/example/client/cli/cli.go
```

### Test

After you have configured everything correctly, you can simply start the example by:

```bash
go run cli.go --domain <your domain> --key <path>
```

This could look like:

```bash
go run cli.go --domain my-domain.zitadel.cloud --key ./api.json
```

This will output something similar to:

```
2023/12/20 08:48:23 INFO retrieved the organisation orgID=165467338479501569 name=DemoOrg
```

## Completion

You have successfully used the ZITADEL Go SDK to call the management API!

If you encountered an error (e.g. `code = PermissionDenied desc = No matching permissions found`),
ensure your service user has the required permissions by assigning the `ORG_OWNER` or `ORG_OWNER_VIEWER` role
and check the mentioned [guides](#prerequisites) at the beginning.

If you've run into any other problem, don't hesitate to contact us or raise an issue on [ZITADEL](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues) or in the [SDK](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/issues).

### Whats next?

Now you can proceed implementing our APIs by adding more calls or using a different service like the SessionService:

```go
api.SessionService().CreateSession(ctx, &session.CreateSessionRequest{})
```
Checkout more [examples from the SDK](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/blob/next/example),
like how you can integrate the [client in your own API](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/blob/next/example/api/client/main.go)
or refer to our [API Docs](/apis/introduction).
