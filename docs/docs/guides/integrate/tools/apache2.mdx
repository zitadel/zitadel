title: Apache 2.0

This integration guide shows you the basic OpenID Connect integration with ZITADEL and an Apache 2.0 server.

## Setup PKCE client in ZITADEL

- Go to your organization and setup a new application with the type PKCE
- When created go to the "Redirect Settings" and *enable Development Mode*
- Add the Redirect Uri, f.e. `http://localhost:8080/secure/callback`
- Add the Post Logout Uri, f.e. `http://localhost:8080/index.html`

You can find the url to your discovery endpoint under "URLs":

## Configure Apache2

### Configure mod_auth_openidc

We use the module `mod_auth_openidc` in this guide.
You can find a minimal configuration in the [official documentation](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/wiki#16-what-does-a-minimal-apache-configuration-file-look-like).

The following parameters must be set with the values from ZITADEL.

```yaml
OIDCProviderMetadataURL https://<your_domain>.zitadel.cloud/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDCClientID <client_id, eg 227791....@apache_test>
# OIDCRedirectURI is a vanity URL that must point to a path protected by this module but must NOT point to any content
OIDCRedirectURI <redirect_uri, eg http://localhost:8080/secure/callback>
OIDCCryptoPassphrase <very-secure-phrase>

OIDCScope "openid profile"
OIDCPKCEMethod S256
```

With the following parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example value|
|---|---|---|
| OIDCProviderMetadataURL | Is the url to the discovery endpoint, which is typically located at `{your-domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration`| `https://<your_domain>.zitadel.cloud/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| OIDCClientID | Is the ID of the zitadel application. You can find it on the settings page of the application.  | 123456789123@apache_test |
| OIDCRedirectURI | Users will be redirected to this page after successful login. If you are using localhost or any other non-https endpoint, make sure to enable development mode in ZITADEL. | https://mysecureapp.io/secure/callback |
| OIDCCryptoPassphrase | Create a secure passphrase. Consult the module's documentation for more details. | ... |
| OIDCScope | OpenID Connect scopes that should be included. You can find a list of [all scopes](/docs/apis/openidoauth/scopes) in our documentation. | "openid profile" |
| OIDCPKCEMethod | The method should be set to `S256` | S256 |

### Secure a route

If you want to secure a route / path then add do so by adding the following Location functionality with the directives:

```text
<Location /secure/>
   AuthType openid-connect
   Require valid-user
</Location>
```

With the same functionality you can also specify if roles / permissions must be present on the user, or limit access to specific users.
Please consult the official documentation on more information.

### Handling logout

Consult the official documentation on how to [logout users](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/wiki#9-how-do-i-logout-users).
Or check out the [example code](#example-code) for a minimal  version.

## Example code

We provide a [minimum boilerplate example](https://github.com/zitadel/example-apache2) to test the integration of ZITADEL with an Apache server.
Follow the instructions in the readme.
