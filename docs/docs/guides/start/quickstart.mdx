In this quick start guide, you’ll learn how to set up Zitadel and use it to secure a React Single Page Application (SPA).

<ResponsivePlayer controls url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5THbQljoPKg' />

This sample app implements the [OIDC PKCE](/docs/guides/integrate/login/oidc/login-users) flow for secure authentication.
- Login: Exchanges a code challenge for an access token via ZITADEL.
- Authorize: Uses the token to retrieve profile data from the userinfo endpoint.
- Logout: Clears the local session and revokes the token.

## Set up and manage ZITADEL for your identity projects

6. Authenticate with the just added method

### 2. Complete onboarding questions

To begin, we'll ask you a few questions.
These will help us understand your needs and improve your ZITADEL experience.

![Onboarding Questions](/img/guides/quickstart/onboarding_questions.png)

### 3. Create your first instance

You can spin up multiple Instances to organize your workflow.

**What is an [Instance](/docs/concepts/structure/instance)?** An Instance is a completely isolated ZITADEL environment with its own users, settings, and data.
You can think of it as a "virtual tenant." Use them to separate your environments (Development, Test, Production) or to manage distinct clients.

1. Click **Create Instance**.

![Create Instance](/img/guides/quickstart/cloud_create_instance.png)

2. Name your instance and click Next.

![Create Instance Name](/img/guides/quickstart/cloud_create_instance_name.png)

3. Choose your Region and click Next.

![Create Instance Region](/img/guides/quickstart/cloud_create_instance_region.png)

4. Set up your Instance Administrator by entering a username and password, then click Next.

### 4. Create your first app

Click **Create your app**. This opens the Management Console in a new tab. Log in using the Admin credentials you just created.
![Create App](/img/guides/quickstart/cloud_create_app.png)

In ZITADEL, Applications live inside Projects.
- [**Project**](/docs/guides/manage/console/projects-overview): A container for grouping apps that share the same users, roles, and permissions (e.g., "Customer Portal").
- [**Application**](/docs/guides/manage/console/applications-overview): The actual technical entry point (e.g., your React web app or a mobile app).

1. Insert “Project1” (or any name of your choice) as the project’s name and select the framework/language of your choice in our case "React" and click the “Continue” button. (If you can't find your framework/languages select "Other")

![Project Name and Framework/Language](/img/guides/quickstart/create_project_react.png)

3. An overview of the configuration for the framework you have selected is shown

- **Recommended Security**: We use [Authorization Code Flow](/docs/apis/openidoauth/grant-types#authorization-code) with [PKCE]((/docs/apis/openidoauth/grant-types#authorization-code)). This is the modern standard for securing web apps by ensuring that only your specific app instance can exchange an auth code for a token.
- **Redirect URIs**: These tell ZITADEL where to send the user after specific actions. For this React sample, they are pre-set to:
  - Redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/callback (where users land after login)
  - Post Logout URI: http://localhost:3000/ (where users land after logging out)

### 5. Obtain ClientId and OIDC endpoints for your application {#referred1}

To connect your React app, you need three key values.

1. **Client ID** Navigate to Configurations in the left menu to find your Client ID. This identifies your app to ZITADEL.
![Get Client ID](/img/guides/quickstart/project_client_id.png)
2. **Issuer & UserInfo URLs** Click on URLs in the left sidebar.
  - **Issuer URL**: This is the most important value. Your OIDC library uses this to automatically discover all other necessary endpoints (like login and token exchange).
  - **Userinfo Endpoint**: Used to fetch the logged-in user's profile details.
![Get URLs](/img/guides/quickstart/project_urls.png)

## Create your React application with ZITADEL OIDC PKCE authentication

### 1. Functional requirements of the application

1. The user navigates to the React app (client) and clicks the "login" button.
2. The app initiates the authorization process by redirecting the user’s browser to the authorization endpoint of the ZITADEL instance, along with the PKCE parameters (code challenge, and code challenge method).
3. The user will see the ZITADEL login page, where the user can enter their credentials.
4. After successful authentication, ZITADEL generates an authorization code and redirects the user back to the React app.
5. The React app sends a request to the ZITADEL token endpoint, along with the authorization code and code verifier.
6. ZITADEL verifies the code verifier to ensure that the authorization request is coming from the same client that initiated it. If it is valid, ZITADEL returns an access token to the React app.
7. The React app uses the access token to make a request to the userinfo endpoint, which is protected by the OIDC protocol.
8. The userinfo endpoint returns information about the logged-in user, such as their name and email address.
9. The React app displays this information to the user.
10. When the user wants to log out, the React app sends a request to the ZITADEL logout endpoint, which clears the access token and ends the user's session.
11. The user will be redirected to the login page of the app.

**_The scope of this application for this quick start guide is limited to user authentication and doesn't include role-based authentication, even though we previously discussed adding roles and users._**

### 2. Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have both Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed on your machine.

To install React, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To install Visual Studio Code, go to their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download and install the version for your operating system.

### 3. Development

#### 1. Create project

1. Open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to create the React app.
3. Run the following command to create a new React app named "react-oidc-zitadel":

   `yarn create react-app react-oidc-zitadel --template typescript`

4. Navigate to the "react-oidc-zitadel" folder:

   `cd react-oidc-zitadel`

5. The dependencies for this project include @zitadel/react and react-router-dom. To include them in your React application, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

   `yarn add @zitadel/react react-router-dom`

#### 2. Add source files

The code needed to run this project can be found [here](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react).

1. Replace the content in your App.js file with the one provided below:

[src/App.tsx](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react/blob/main/src/App.tsx):

```
  const config: ZitadelConfig = {
    authority: "[YOUR-INSTANCE-URL]",
    client_id: "[YOUR-CLIENT-ID]",
    redirect_uri: "[YOUR-REDIRECT-URI]",
    post_logout_redirect_uri: "[YOUR-POST-LOGOUT-REDIRECT-URI]",
  };

  const zitadel = createZitadelAuth(config);
  ...
```

The App.tsx file is the root component of the React app that initializes the OIDC flow and manages the user's session. It does this by:

- Importing the necessary libraries and components from the dependencies, including the `@zitadel/react` library and the Login and Callback components.
- Initializing a new `zitadel` instance with the OIDC configuration values. The `zitadel` instance manages the OIDC flow and stores the user's session information.
- Defining two functions: `authorize` and `signout`. The `authorize` function initiates the OIDC flow when the user clicks the `login` button, while the `signout` function ends the user's session when the user clicks the `logout` button.
- Defining state variable: `authenticated`. The authenticated variable is a boolean that indicates whether the user is authenticated or not.
- Using the `useEffect` hook to retrieve the user's session information from the `UserManager` instance and updating the `authenticated` state variable accordingly.
- Defining the routes for the app using the `react-router-dom` library, including the `/` and `/callback` routes for the login and callback pages, respectively. The `Login` and `Callback` components handle the login and callback processes, respectively.

The provided config extends the `UserManagerSettings` of the `oidc-client-ts` library. Take a look at some of the available configuration options:

- authority (the URL of your instance ending with /).
- client\*id (the unique identifier for the client application).
- redirect_uri (the URL to redirect to after the authorization flow is complete)
- post_logout_redirect_uri (the URL to redirect to after the user logs out)
- scope (the permissions requested from the user)
- project_resource_id (To add a ZITADEL project scope. `urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:id:[projectId]:aud` and `urn:zitadel:iam:org:projects:roles` [scopes](/docs/apis/openidoauth/scopes#reserved-scopes).)
- prompt ([the OIDC prompt parameter](/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#additional-parameters))

2. Create a folder named components in the src directory. Create two files named Login.js and Callback.js.

3. Paste the following code to Login.tsx.

```ts reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react/blob/main/src/components/Login.tsx
```

The `/` route corresponds to the login page, which is rendered by the Login component. The Login(Login.tsx) component is a functional component that displays the login button and calls the `handleLogin` function (which corresponds to the `authorize` function defined in the App component) when the button is clicked. This initiates the OIDC flow by redirecting the user to the authorization endpoint.

4. Paste the following code to Callback.js.

```ts reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react/blob/main/src/components/Callback.tsx
```

The `/callback` route corresponds to the callback page, which is rendered by the Callback (Callback.tsx) component.
The Callback component is also a functional component that handles the callback from the authorization server after the user logs in.
It retrieves the authorization code from the URL, exchanges it for an access token and id token, and retrieves the user's information from the userinfo endpoint.
It also sets the `authenticated` state variable in the App (App.tsx) component and displays the `logout` button.
When the `logout` button is clicked, the `clearAuth` function is called and the user's session is ended. The `clearAuth` function is defined in the App component and is called with no arguments. It initiates the end session flow by redirecting the user to the end session endpoint.

Note that the @zitadel/react library automatically handles the generation of the code verifier and code challenge when the user clicks on the login button, eliminating the need for the application to manually generate and include these values in the requests.

In the PKCE flow, the code verifier is a random string generated by the client application, and the code challenge is a transformed version of the code verifier using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

5. Now you can think about styling your application. Edit the `index.css` and `App.css` to apply CSS styling to the pages.

### 3. Running the application

1. Run `yarn start` to start the development server.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the app.
3. You will see the login page, which is the landing page of the app, when you run the application. Click on the “Please log in” button.

![Login](/img/guides/quickstart/login1.png)

4. You will be redirected to the ZITADEL login page. Add your username/email and click on “next”.

![Redirect](/img/guides/quickstart/login2.png)

5. Enter your password and click on “next”.

![Redirect](/img/guides/quickstart/login3.png)

6. If you entered the correct login credentials (and if the PKCE parameters generated by the application match), you will be redirected to the callback page, which displays your user information.

![Redirect](/img/guides/quickstart/login4.png)

7. You can click on “Log out” to log out of the application and you will be taken to the landing page.
