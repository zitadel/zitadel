In this quick start guide, you’ll learn how to set up Zitadel and use it to secure a React Single Page Application (SPA).

<ResponsivePlayer controls url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5THbQljoPKg' />

This sample app implements the [OIDC PKCE](/docs/guides/integrate/login/oidc/login-users) flow for secure authentication.
- Login: Exchanges a code challenge for an access token via ZITADEL.
- Authorize: Uses the token to retrieve profile data from the userinfo endpoint.
- Logout: Clears the local session and revokes the token.

## Set up and manage ZITADEL for your identity projects

### 1. Sign up for the ZITADEL Cloud customer portal and register your organization

1. Go to [zitadel.com](http://zitadel.com) and click “Sign up”.

6. Authenticate with the just added method

### 2. Complete onboarding questions

To begin, we'll ask you a few questions.
These will help us understand your needs and improve your ZITADEL experience.

![Onboarding Questions](/img/guides/quickstart/onboarding_questions.png)

### 3. Create your first instance

You can spin up multiple Instances to organize your workflow.

**What is an [Instance](/docs/concepts/structure/instance)?** An Instance is a completely isolated ZITADEL environment with its own users, settings, and data.
You can think of it as a "virtual tenant." Use them to separate your environments (Development, Test, Production) or to manage distinct clients.

1. Click **Create Instance**.

![Create Instance](/img/guides/quickstart/cloud_create_instance.png)

2. Name your instance and click Next.

![Create Instance Name](/img/guides/quickstart/cloud_create_instance_name.png)

3. Choose your Region and click Next.

![Create Instance Region](/img/guides/quickstart/cloud_create_instance_region.png)

4. Set up your Instance Administrator by entering a username and password, then click Next.

![Create Instance Admin](/img/guides/quickstart/cloud_create_instance_admin.png)

5. Click Create Instance to finalize your setup.

### 4. Create your first app

Click **Create your app**. This opens the Management Console in a new tab. Log in using the Admin credentials you just created.

In ZITADEL, Applications live inside Projects.
- [**Project**](/docs/guides/manage/console/projects-overview): A container for grouping apps that share the same users, roles, and permissions (e.g., "Customer Portal").
- [**Application**](/docs/guides/manage/console/applications-overview): The actual technical entry point (e.g., your React web app or a mobile app).

1. Insert “Project1” (or any name of your choice) as the project’s name and select the framework/language of your choice in our case "React" and click the “Continue” button. (If you can't find your framework/languages select "Other")

![Project Name and Framework/Language](/img/guides/quickstart/create_project_react.png)

3. An overview of the configuration for the framework you have selected is shown

- **Recommended Security**: We use [Authorization Code Flow](/docs/apis/openidoauth/grant-types#authorization-code) with [PKCE]((/docs/apis/openidoauth/grant-types#authorization-code)). This is the modern standard for securing web apps by ensuring that only your specific app instance can exchange an auth code for a token.
- **Redirect URIs**: These tell ZITADEL where to send the user after specific actions. For this React sample, they are pre-set to:
  - Redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/callback (where users land after login)
  - Post Logout URI: http://localhost:3000/ (where users land after logging out)

### 5. Obtain ClientId and OIDC endpoints for your application {#referred1}

To connect your React app, you need three key values.

1. **Client ID** Navigate to Configurations in the left menu to find your Client ID. This identifies your app to ZITADEL.
![Get Client ID](/img/guides/quickstart/project_client_id.png)
2. **Issuer** Click on URLs in the left sidebar and then discovery endpoint, copy the issuer url
  - **Issuer URL**: This is the most important value. Your OIDC library uses this to automatically discover all other necessary endpoints (like login and token exchange).

## Create your React application with ZITADEL OIDC PKCE authentication

### The Authentication Flow
Here is how your React app interacts with ZITADEL using OIDC and PKCE:
1. **Login**: The user clicks "Login," and the app redirects them to ZITADEL with a PKCE challenge.
2. **Auth**: The user logs in via the ZITADEL hosted page.
3. **Code Exchange**: ZITADEL redirects back with an auth code. The app exchanges this code (and the PKCE verifier) for an access token.
4. **Profile**: The app calls the /userinfo endpoint with the token to get the user's name and email.
5. **Logout**: The user logs out; the app clears the token and ends the ZITADEL session.

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js]((https://nodejs.org/)): Version 16 or later is recommended.
- [Visual Studio Code]((https://code.visualstudio.com/)): Or your preferred code editor.

### 2. Get the Example App

To get you up and running quickly, we’ve prepared a React boilerplate using the Zitadel react sdk.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react.git
cd zitadel-react
```

### 3. Build the SDK

Navigate to the `/lib` folder and run `yarn install` and `yarn build`.

```bash
cd ./lib
yarn install
yarn build
```

Then, navigate back and install the dependencies

```bash
cd ..
yarn install
```

### 4. Add client ID and issuer

Open `src/App.tsx` and replace the placeholder for *authority* and *client_id* with the values from the previous steps (issuer, client id):

```js
const config: ZitadelConfig = {
    authority: "https://CUSTOM_DOMAIN",
    client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000/callback",
    post_logout_redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000",
    response_type: 'code',
    scope: 'openid profile email'
};
```

### 5. Start the app

```bash
yarn start
```

Your application will then run on `http://localhost:3000`
