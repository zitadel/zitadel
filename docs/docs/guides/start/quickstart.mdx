import { ResponsivePlayer } from "../../../src/components/player";

In this quick start guide, we will be learning some fundamentals on how to set up ZITADEL for user management and application security. Thereafter, we will secure a React-based Single Page Application (SPA) using ZITADEL.

<ResponsivePlayer controls url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5THbQljoPKg' />

The sample application allows users to securely log in to ZITADEL using the OIDC Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) flow. This flow ensures that the authentication process is secure by using a code verifier and a code challenge, which are sent to ZITADEL to obtain an access token. The access token is then used by the app to access the userinfo endpoint to retrieve and display information about the logged-in user. The app also has a logout feature that allows users to end their session and clear their access token. Overall, the app provides a simple and secure way for users to authenticate and access protected resources within ZITADEL.

## ZITADEL terminology: instances, organizations, projects, users, roles, role assignments, and applications

In ZITADEL, instances, organizations, projects, users, roles, and applications are the main components that make up the platform.

The order of creation for the above components would typically be as follows:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Instance</b>: An instance is a top-level entity in ZITADEL that
    represents a deployment of ZITADEL for a registered account. An instance can
    have one or more organizations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Organization</b>: An organization is a logical separation within an
    instance that represents a company/organization and can have one or more
    projects. The default organization is the one that is provided at the start
    of the account registration process. Typically, an instance would have one
    organization, but in B2B scenarios, an instance would have more than one.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Project</b>: A project is a logical separation within an organization and
    is a container for applications, roles and role assignment policies for the resources
    it contains.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Users</b>: Users are created at the organizational level and are granted
    access to the resources within projects. They can be assigned different
    roles, which define the permissions and privileges they have within the
    project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Roles</b>: Roles are the sets of permissions and privileges that are
    assigned to users within a project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Role Assignments</b>: Role Assignment policies in ZITADEL are defined at the
    project level, which means that they apply to all the resources within the
    project. These policies are based on the roles that are assigned to users,
    and they determine the actions that users are allowed to perform within the
    project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Applications</b>: Applications are developed and managed within
    a project. They can be client applications that use the resources within the
    project, or they can be backend applications that provide the resources for other
    applications to use. The applications can use the OIDC or SAML protocol to authenticate
    users to access protected resources.
  </li>
</ul>

The order of creation for the above components may vary depending on the specific needs and requirements of the organization.

4. Next, you'll create an application within your newly created project. Click on "New" to start creating your application.

5. Provide a name for your application (e.g., "React App") and choose the type of your application.
There are five different application types to choose from.
For this quick start guide, we will select "User Agent" as our application type, and click "Continue".

![Select Application Type](/img/guides/quickstart/create_react_app_1.png)

6. In the next step, choose the Authentication Method for your application.
For this example, we will select "PKCE" and click "Continue".
We recommend using the Authentication Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for secure OIDC configuration.

![Select Authentication Method](/img/guides/quickstart/create_react_app_2.png)

7. We will now configure the Redirect URLs for our application.
These are the allowed URLs where ZITADEL redirects the users they have been authenticated.
Enable the "Development Mode" if you are developing locally.
The "Redirect URI" is preconfigured to http://localhost:3000/callback and the “Post Logout URI” to http://localhost:3000/ for the [React App example](docs/docs/guides/start/quickstart.mdx#create-your-react-application-with-zitadel-oidc-pkce-authentication).

![Configure Redirect URLs](/img/guides/quickstart/create_react_app_redirect_urls.png)

8. Click on "Continue" to proceed further, and you will see an overview of your application configuration.

9. Finally, click on "Create" to complete the application setup. The client ID and client secret (if necessary) are displayed after the successful creation of the application.
Please make sure to copy and securely store the client secret.

![Client ID and Secret](/img/guides/quickstart/create_react_app_client_id_secret.png)

10. After creating the application, you will see a summary of your application's configuration.

![Application Summary](/img/guides/quickstart/react_app_overview.png)

More detailed information about creating applications can be found in [here](docs/docs/guides/manage/console/applications.mdx).

### 5. Add users (optional)

1. To add users, click on “Users” at the top menu. You will see that the user you already created is listed as a user here. Click on the “New” button to create a new user.

![Users](/img/guides/quickstart/users_existing.png)

2. Let’s add another user as shown below. Fill in the user details as shown below and click on the “Create” button when you are done.

![Add User](/img/guides/quickstart/create_new_user.png)

3. The newly created user details will be displayed as shown below.

4. Once you navigate back to the "Users" view, you will see a list of all the users that have been added to your instance. If you need to add more users, you can do so.

![User Info](/img/guides/quickstart/users.png)

### 6. Add roles to your project (optional)

1. To add roles to your project, click on “Roles” on the left as shown below. Next, click on the “New” button.

![Add Roles](/img/guides/quickstart/project_add_role.png)

2. Let’s create the role “manager” as shown below. Add “Manager” and “Group1” as display name and group respectively.

![Add Role](/img/guides/quickstart/create_role.png)

3. You can also add other roles in this step by clicking on “Add additional role”. Let’s go ahead and add two more as shown below. Click “Save” when you are done.

![Add Role](/img/guides/quickstart/add_multiple_roles.png)

4. Now you can view a list of all the roles you just created.

![Add Role](/img/guides/quickstart/view_roles.png)

### 7. Add role assignments to your project (optional)

1. Click on “Role Assignments” on the top menu.

![Add Role Assignment](/img/guides/quickstart/role_assignments.png)

2. Select users to assign the roles. You can select one or more users for a single role assignment. Let’s select all the users for this role assignment.

![Add Role Assignment](/img/guides/quickstart/select_users_role_assignment.png)

3. Next, select a project. Since we created only “Project1” so far, you will see just that. Go ahead and select it.

![Add Role Assignment](/img/guides/quickstart/add_all_users_role_assignment.png)

4. Let’s select the role “sales”. Click on “Save”.

![Add Role Assignment](/img/guides/quickstart/assign_role.png)

5. Now you will see the users with their designated roles.

![Add Role Assignment](/img/guides/quickstart/role_assigned_view.png)

6. To assign additional roles to a user, you can click on the user's name and select the desired roles from the list. This will grant the user additional permissions within the project. Click on “Change”.

![Add Role Assignment](/img/guides/quickstart/assing_additional_role.png)

7. You can see that additional roles have been assigned to the users in this updated assigned roles list and this should now give you an indication of how role assignments work in ZITADEL.

![Add Role Assignment](/img/guides/quickstart/additional_roles_view.png)

### 8. Obtain ClientID and OIDC endpoints for your application {#referred1}

You will need the `Client ID` and the `OIDC endpoints` (`issuer` and `Userinfo Endpoint`) when building your application.
The `issuer` URL is the base URL for the OIDC provider and includes the path to the OIDC discovery document, which contains information about the OIDC provider, including the authorization and token endpoints.
By providing the `issuer` URL, you can use the OIDC library to automatically determine the endpoints for these requests.

* The `Authorization Endpoint` is used to initiate the authorization process
* The `Token Endpoint` is used to exchange authorization codes for access tokens
* The `Userinfo Endpoint` is used to retrieve information about the user. You need an access token to access the `Userinfo Endpoint` and other protected resources.

1. Click on “Configuration” to access the `Client ID` as shown below:

![Get URLs](/img/guides/quickstart/project_app_config.png)

2. The `issuer` URL and the `Userinfo Endpoint` can be accessed under the “URLs” section on the left.
Specifically, the `issuer` URL can be retrieved from the discovery endpoint.

![Get URLs](/img/guides/quickstart/react_app_urls.png)

And with that, configuring ZITADEL for our application is complete. Now we can move on to building our React application. Let's get coding!

## Create your React Application with ZITADEL OIDC PKCE Authentication

### 1. Functional requirements of the application

1. The user navigates to the application (client) and clicks the "login" button.
2. The application initiates the authorization process by redirecting the user’s browser to the authorization endpoint of the ZITADEL instance, along with the PKCE parameters (code challenge, and code challenge method).
3. The user will see the ZITADEL login page, where the user can enter their credentials.
4. After successful authentication, ZITADEL generates an authorization code and redirects the user back to the application.
5. The application sends a request to the ZITADEL token endpoint, along with the authorization code and code verifier.
6. ZITADEL verifies the code verifier to ensure that the authorization request is coming from the same client that initiated it. If it is valid, ZITADEL returns an access token to the application.
7. The application uses the access token to make a request to the userinfo endpoint, which is protected by the OIDC protocol.
8. The userinfo endpoint returns information about the logged-in user, such as their name and email address.
9. The application displays this information to the user.
10. When the user wants to log out, the application sends a request to the ZITADEL logout endpoint, which clears the access token and ends the user's session.
11. The user will be redirected to the login page of the application.

**_The scope of this application for this quick start guide is limited to user authentication and doesn't include role-based authentication, even though we previously discussed adding roles and users._**

### 2. Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have both Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) installed on your machine.

To install React, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To install Visual Studio Code, go to their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download and install the version for your operating system.

### 3. Development

#### 1. Create project

1. Open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to create the React app.
3. Run the following command to create a new React app named "react-oidc-zitadel":

   `yarn create react-app react-oidc-zitadel --template typescript`

4. Navigate to the "react-oidc-zitadel" folder:

   `cd react-oidc-zitadel`

5. The dependencies for this project include @zitadel/react and react-router-dom. To include them in your React application, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

   `yarn add @zitadel/react react-router-dom`

#### 2. Add source files

The code needed to run this project can be found [here](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react).

1. Replace the content in your App.js file with the one provided below:

[src/App.tsx](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react/blob/main/src/App.tsx):

```
  const config: ZitadelConfig = {
    authority: "[YOUR-INSTANCE-URL]",
    client_id: "[YOUR-CLIENT-ID]",
    redirect_uri: "[YOUR-REDIRECT-URI]",
    post_logout_redirect_uri: "[YOUR-POST-LOGOUT-REDIRECT-URI]",
  };

  const zitadel = createZitadelAuth(config);
  ...
```

The App.tsx file is the root component of the React app that initializes the OIDC flow and manages the user's session. It does this by:

- Importing the necessary libraries and components from the dependencies, including the `@zitadel/react` library and the Login and Callback components.
- Initializing a new `zitadel` instance with the OIDC configuration values. The `zitadel` instance manages the OIDC flow and stores the user's session information.
- Defining two functions: `authorize` and `signout`. The `authorize` function initiates the OIDC flow when the user clicks the `login` button, while the `signout` function ends the user's session when the user clicks the `logout` button.
- Defining state variable: `authenticated`. The authenticated variable is a boolean that indicates whether the user is authenticated or not.
- Using the `useEffect` hook to retrieve the user's session information from the `UserManager` instance and updating the `authenticated` state variable accordingly.
- Defining the routes for the app using the `react-router-dom` library, including the `/` and `/callback` routes for the login and callback pages, respectively. The `Login` and `Callback` components handle the login and callback processes, respectively.

The provided config extends the `UserManagerSettings` of the `oidc-client-ts` library. Take a look at some of the available configuration options:

- authority (the URL of your instance ending with /).
- client\*id (the unique identifier for the client application).
- redirect_uri (the URL to redirect to after the authorization flow is complete)
- post_logout_redirect_uri (the URL to redirect to after the user logs out)
- scope (the permissions requested from the user)
- project_resource_id (To add a ZITADEL project scope. `urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:id:[projectId]:aud` and `urn:zitadel:iam:org:projects:roles` [scopes](/docs/apis/openidoauth/scopes#reserved-scopes).)
- prompt ([the OIDC prompt parameter](/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#additional-parameters))

2. Create a folder named components in the src directory. Create two files named Login.js and Callback.js.

3. Paste the following code to Login.tsx.

```ts reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react/blob/main/src/components/Login.tsx
```

The `/` route corresponds to the login page, which is rendered by the Login component. The Login(Login.tsx) component is a functional component that displays the login button and calls the `handleLogin` function (which corresponds to the `authorize` function defined in the App component) when the button is clicked. This initiates the OIDC flow by redirecting the user to the authorization endpoint.

4. Paste the following code to Callback.js.

```ts reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-react/blob/main/src/components/Callback.tsx
```

The `/callback` route corresponds to the callback page, which is rendered by the Callback (Callback.tsx) component.
The Callback component is also a functional component that handles the callback from the authorization server after the user logs in.
It retrieves the authorization code from the URL, exchanges it for an access token and id token, and retrieves the user's information from the userinfo endpoint.
It also sets the `authenticated` state variable in the App (App.tsx) component and displays the `logout` button.
When the `logout` button is clicked, the `clearAuth` function is called and the user's session is ended. The `clearAuth` function is defined in the App component and is called with no arguments. It initiates the end session flow by redirecting the user to the end session endpoint.

Note that the @zitadel/react library automatically handles the generation of the code verifier and code challenge when the user clicks on the login button, eliminating the need for the application to manually generate and include these values in the requests.

In the PKCE flow, the code verifier is a random string generated by the client application, and the code challenge is a transformed version of the code verifier using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

5. Now you can think about styling your application. Edit the `index.css` and `App.css` to apply CSS styling to the pages.

### 3. Running the application

1. Run `yarn start` to start the development server.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the app.
3. You will see the login page, which is the landing page of the app, when you run the application. Click on the “Please log in” button.

![Login](/img/guides/quickstart/login1.png)

4. You will be redirected to the ZITADEL login page. Add your username/email and click on “next”.

![Redirect](/img/guides/quickstart/login2.png)

5. Enter your password and click on “next”.

![Redirect](/img/guides/quickstart/login3.png)

6. If you entered the correct login credentials (and if the PKCE parameters generated by the application match), you will be redirected to the callback page, which displays your user information.

![Redirect](/img/guides/quickstart/login4.png)

7. You can click on “Log out” to log out of the application and you will be taken to the landing page.

![Redirect](/img/guides/quickstart/login1.png)

And this brings us to the end of this quick start guide!
