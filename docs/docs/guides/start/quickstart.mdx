Most applications need to know the identity of a user allowing to securely store user data in the cloud and provide the same personalised experience across all of the user's devices.

ZITADEL's authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users in your application. It supports authentication using passwords and applies additional security with the help of a second factor, for example OTP, to ensure a safe and secure access.
It additionally leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect such that it can be easily integrated in your custom backend.

ZITADEL currently support two ways of using it:
- Use the ZITADEL Cloud free tier to get started in minutes
- Deploy a self-hosted ZITADEL, where ever you like

## Elect New Managers

:::note
This takes place in the ZITADEL Console
:::

ZITADEL allows you to give other users control over the ZITADEL Console. The manager role can be restricted to some kind of write and/or read.
This is especially useful for direct administration over several users. You can have managers able to edit project settings and others able to create/add users only.

> Note: ZITADEL Managers are located on the right side panel of the ZITADEL Console.
