Most applications need to know the identity of a user allowing to securely store user data in the cloud and provide the same personalised experience across all of the user's devices.

ZITADEL's authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users in your application. It supports authentication using passwords and applies additional security with the help of a second factor, for example OTP, to ensure a safe and secure access.
It additionally leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect such that it can be easily integrated in your custom backend.

This provides a quick start guide on how to register your organization as well as creating your first project.

## Trying out ZITADEL on zitadel.ch

To create a ZITADEL project, you have to register as an organization first. Click [here](https://accounts.zitadel.ch/register/org) to register.
You will receive an email prompting you to verify your mail.
Then go to your [Console Projects](https://console.zitadel.ch/projects) view and create a new project.

Now you can proceed adding users to your organization as well as integrating your applications. We refer to our guides as well as our [Quickstarts](../../quickstarts/introduction) to do so.

#### Verify your domain name (optional)

If you verify a domain you get the benefit that your organisations users can use this domain as the **preferred logonname**.

#### Elect Managers

ZITADEL allows you to give other users control over ZITADEL Console itself. This can be restricted to some kind of write and/or read. This can be especially useful for directing administration over several users. You can have managers able to edit project settings and others able to create/add users only.
Read the [guides](../introduction) for more information.

> Note: ZITADEL Managers are always located on the right sidepanel of console.

#### Integrating an application

After creating your project you can start integrating your applications.
After choosing your [project](https://console.zitadel.ch/projects) add a client application on the top of the page.
The wizard should provide some guidance what client is the proper for you. If you are still unsure consult our [Guide Project](projects).
