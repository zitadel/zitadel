title: Actions
---

An Identity and Management system is a very interactive place. ZITADEL has built in functionality to react to its events. This functionality is called **Actions** and can be accessed from your organizations top navigation.

Actions allow you to define scripts which are then run on certain triggers.
To add an action, click at the **new** button and provide a script and a name.
You can specify a timeout and whether the action is allowed to fail too.

To run those scripts, a flow with a trigger has to be created.
This could for example be a **External Authentication** Flow, with a **Post Authentication** trigger.

Now whenever a user gets authenticated externally with an IDP, a action is triggered after the authentication itself.
If you want to know more where actions can be useful, take a look at the feature [here](/docs/concepts/features/actions) or directly jump to an example of a custom behaviour [here](/docs/guides/manage/customize/behavior).
