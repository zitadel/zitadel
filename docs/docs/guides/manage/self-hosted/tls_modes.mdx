title: TLS Modes
---

To allow ZITADEL to be run on any kind of infrastrucute it allows to configure on how tho handle TLS connections.
There are three mode of operation:  `external`, `enabled`, `disabled`.

Generally this command is set as argument while starting ZITADEL. For example like this:

```bash
zitadel start-from-init --masterkey "MasterkeyNeedsToHave32Characters" --tlsMode disabled
```

## External 

The mode `external` allows you to configure ZITADEL in such a way that it will instruct its clients to use https.
However ZITADEL delegates the management of TLS connections to a reverseproxy, web application firewall or a service mesh.

## Enabled

When using the mode `enabled` ZITADEL is setup to await incoming connections in an encrypted fashion. 
Wether it is from a client directly, a reverseproxy or web application firewall.
This allows http connections to be secured at the transport level the whole way.

If you use the mode `enabled` you need to configure ZITADEL with the nessecary TLS settings.

```yaml
TLS:
  # if enabled, ZITADEL will serve all traffic over TLS (HTTPS and gRPC)
  # you must then also provide a private key and certificate to be used for the connection
  # either directly or by a path to the corresponding file
  Enabled: true
  # Path to the private key of the TLS certificate, it will be loaded into the Key
  # and overwrite any exising value
  KeyPath: #/path/to/key/file.pem
  # Private key of the TLS certificate (KeyPath will this overwrite, if specified)
  Key: #<bas64 encoded content of a pem file>
  # Path to the certificate for the TLS connection, it will be loaded into the Cert
  # and overwrite any exising value
  CertPath: #/path/to/cert/file.pem
  # Certificate for the TLS connection (CertPath will this overwrite, if specified)
  Cert: #<bas64 encoded content of a pem file>
```
 
## Disabled

With the mode `disabled` ZITADEL is instructed to await all connections with plain http without TLS.

:::caution

Be aware this is not a secure setup and should only be used for test systems!

:::

## HTTP/2

To allow ZITADEL to function properly please make sure that HTTP/2 is enabled. If you are using the mode `external` or `disabled` make sure to verify h2c compatibilty.
You can read more about how ZITADEL utilizes in our [HTTP/2 docs](/docs/guides/manage/self-hosted/http2).
