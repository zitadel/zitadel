title: HTTP/2 Support
---

ZITADEL follows a strict API first approach and makes heavy use of the modern API framework called [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).
Besides gRPC all APIs are also available in an openapi Rest fashion as well as in gRPC-web for compatibilty towards browser integrations.

To make us of gRPC it is vital to allow your clients to communicate with ZITADEL with [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2).

Sometimes you need to configure explicitly that you want to use HTTP/2 if you run ZITADEL behind a reverse proxy and below you should find examples for different vendors and projects.

Furthermore it is important to notice that by default HTTP/2 is always encrypted, but if you want to run ZITADEL without TLS from your reverse proxy or service mesh this is possible through [h2c](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/http2.html).
Oftentimes when you run ZITADEL inside a service mesh, or a servelerss offering (e.g. Google Cloud Run, Knative, ...) you will need h2c.

You can read more about ZITADEL's [TLSs modes here](/docs/guides/manage/self-hosted/tls_modes).
