## Payment Method

If you click on the "+" Button a popup will be shown with the needed fields to add a new payment method.
At the moment we provide only "Credit Card" payment

Once a payment method is configured, it can be selected directly in the instance creation process.

## Customer 

To be able to create correct billings we will need some customer information from you.
This includes the following fields:
- Name
- Country
- Email address
- Address line 1
- Address line 2
- Postal Code

## Update Billing Information

You will only need to add billing information if your instance is in the paid tier. There are two options on how to add your billing info.

2. Go to the billing menu and add a new payment method. You will be able to choose the added method, when upgrading the instance to the paid tier.
3. Add the billing information directly during the upgrade process.
