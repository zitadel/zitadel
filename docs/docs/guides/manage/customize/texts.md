title: Customized Texts
---

You are able to customize the texts used from ZITADEL. This is possibly on the instance or organization level.

## Message Texts
Sometimes the users will get an email or phone message from ZITADEL (e.g Password Reset Request).
ZITADEL already has some good standard texts, but maybe you would like to customize it for your organization.

Go to the message text policy on your organization and you will find the different kinds of messages that are sent from ZITADEL. 
Choose the template and the language you like to edit. 
You can now change all the texts from a message. 
As soon as you click into a input field you will see some attribute chips below the field. 
These are the parameters you can include on this specific message.

## Login Texts

Like the message texts you are also able to change the texts on the login interface. 
First choose the screen and the language you like to edit. 
You will see the default texts in the input field and you can overwrite them by typing into the box.

## Reset to default
