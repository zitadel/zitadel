End Users have three different possibilities on how to login with ZITADEL.
1. Local Account with Username, Password, MFA, Passkey, etc
2. Social Login like Google, Apple, Github, etc
3. External Identity Provider hosted/managed by Organization like Azure AD, LDAP, Okta etc

You can either use the hosted login of ZITADEL to let users register themselves, or you can build your own UI and use the existing APIs.

### Built-in register form

#### Local User Registration

To allow users to register themselves, you have to enable the "register allowed" in the login behaviour settings.
You will now see the register button on the login screen.

If nothing else is specified, a user will be registered to the default organization.

You can specify another organization, by sending the organization scope in the authorization requests.
By sending the scope below the settings of the specified organization will be triggered and only users of the said organization will be able to authenticate.
The users will be registered to the given organization.
```
urn:zitadel:iam:org:id:{id}
```

If the user chooses to register a local account, the register form will be shown.
All the mandatory fields like given name, family name, e-mail and password have to be filled.
With the built-in form, currently only password authentication can be configured in the first place.

#### Registration with Social Login

To allow your users to register with social logins you have to configure the needed external identity providers.
If you only need the social logins for your end users and you want to have them all in the organization, we recommend using the default organization for those users.
In that case you can configure the identity providers on the default organization.
If you want to have the social logins on different organizations you can configure the default on the instance, and enable it on the needed orgnaizations.

Please follow the configuration guides for the needed providers: [Let Users Login with Preferred Identity Provider in ZITADEL](/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers)

The configured providers will be shown on the first login screen or when the users click on the registration button, they will be able to choose between local account or the social login.

#### Registration with Organization External Identity Provider

If your business customer already have an identity provider, and you want to allow SSO for them, you can configure their providers directly for their organization.
Configure the needed provider such as Azure AD or OKTA.

Please follow the configuration guides for the needed providers: [Let Users Login with Preferred Identity Provider in ZITADEL](/docs/guides/integrate/identity-providers)

import OrgLoginDescription from "./_org_login_description.mdx";

<OrgLoginDescription name="OrgLodinDescription" />

### Build your own registration form

ZITADEL allows you to build your own registration form and login UI.
The registration process highly depends on your needs.

We do have a guide series on how to build your own login ui, which also includes the registration of different authentication methods, such as:
- Password authentication
- Multi-Factor
- Passkeys
- External Login Providers

You can find all the guides here: [Build your own login UI](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/login-ui)

The create user request also allows you to add metadata (key, value) to the user.
This gives you the possibility to collect additional data from your users during the registration process and store it directly to the user in ZITADEL.
We recommend storing business relevant data in the database of your application, and only authentication and authorization relevant data in ZITADEL to follow the separation of concern pattern.
