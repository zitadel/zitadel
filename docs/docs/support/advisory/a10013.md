## Date

## Description

ZITADEL currently provides a "latest" and "stable" release tags as well as maintenance branches, where bug fixes are backported.
We also publish release candidates regularly.

The "stable" release channel was introduced for users seeking a more reliable and production-ready version of the software.
However, most customers have their own deployment policies and cycles. 
Backports and security fixes are currently done as needed or required by customers. 
zitadel.cloud follows a similar approach, where the latest release is deployed a few days after its creation.

## Mitigation

If you used the "stable" Docker release, please consider switching to a specific version tag and follow the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases) for latest changes.

## Impact

The "stable" version will no longer be published or updated, and the corresponding Docker image tag will not be maintained anymore.
