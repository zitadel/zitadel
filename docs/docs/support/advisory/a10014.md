## Date

Versions: >= v2.67.3, v2.66 >= v2.66.6

Date: 2025-01-17

## Description

Prior to version [v2.66.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.66.0), some project grants were incorrectly created under the granted organization instead of the project owner's organization. To find these grants, users had to set the `x-zitadel-orgid` header to the granted organization ID when using the [`ListAllProjectGrants`](/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-add-project-grant) gRPC method.

Zitadel [v2.66.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.66.0) corrected this behavior for new grants. However, existing grants were not automatically updated. Version v2.66.6 corrects the owner of these existing grants.

## Impact

After the release of v2.66.6, if your application uses the [`ListAllProjectGrants`](/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-add-project-grant) method with the `x-zitadel-orgid` header set to the granted organization ID, you will not retrieve any results.

## Mitigation

To ensure your application continues to function correctly after the release of v2.66.6, implement the following changes:

1. **Conditional Header:** Only set the `x-zitadel-orgid` header to the project owner's organization ID if the user executing the [`ListAllProjectGrants`](/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-add-project-grant) method belongs to a different organization than the project.
2. **Use `grantedOrgIdQuery`:** Utilize the `grantedOrgIdQuery` parameter to filter grants for the specific granted organization.
