title: Technical Advisory 10015
---

## Date

Versions: >= v3.0.0

Date: 2025-03-31

## Description

CockroachDB was initially chosen due to its distributed nature and SQL compatibility. However, over time, it became apparent that the operational complexity and specific compatibility issues outweighed the benefits for our use case. We decided to focus on PostgreSQL to simplify our infrastructure and leverage its mature ecosystem.

## Impact

Zitadel v3 requires PostgreSQL as a database. Therefore, Zitadel v3 will not start if CockroachDB is configured as the database.

## Mitigation

To upgrade your self-hosted deployment to Zitadel v3 migrate to PostgreSQL. Please refer to [this guide](/docs/self-hosting/manage/cli/mirror) to mirror the data to PostgreSQL before you deploy Zitadel v3.
