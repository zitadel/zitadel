Versions:[^1]

- v2.65.x: > v2.65.9

Last updated: 2025-05-14

[^1]: The mentioned fix is being rolled out gradually on multiple patch releases of Zitadel. This advisory will be updated as we release these versions.

## Description

### Background

Zitadel uses a eventstore table as main source of truth for state changes.
Projections are tables which provide alternative views of state, which are built using events.
In order to know which events are reduced into projections, we use a `position` column in the eventstore and a dedicated table which records the current state.

### Problem

Zitadel prior to the listed version had a precision bug. The `position` column uses a fixed-point numeric type. In Zitadel's Go code we used a `float64`. In certain cases we noticed a precision loss when Zitadel updated the `current_states` table.

## Impact

During a past attempt to fix this, we got reports of failing projections inside Zitadel. Because the precision became exact certain compare operations like *equal*, *less then*, etc would now return different results. This was because the values in `current_states` would already have lost precision from a broken version. This might happen to **some** deployments or projections: there is only a small probability.

We are releasing the fix again and your system might get affected.

- Follow-up issue: [8863](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/8863)

## Mitigation

When **after** deploying a fixed version and only when experiencing problems described by issue [8863](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/8863), the following queries can be executed to fix `current_state` rows which have "broken" values. We recommend doing this in a transaction in order to double-check the affected rows, before committing the update.

```sql
begin;

with
  broken as (
    select
      s.projection_name,
      s.instance_id,
      s.aggregate_id,
      s.aggregate_type,
      s.sequence,
      s."position" as old_position,
      e."position" as new_position
    from
      projections.current_states s
      join eventstore.events2 e on s.instance_id = e.instance_id
      and s.aggregate_id = e.aggregate_id
      and s.aggregate_type = e.aggregate_type
      and s.sequence = e.sequence
      and s."position" != e."position"
    where
      s."position" != 0
      and projection_name != 'projections.execution_handler'
  ),fixed as (
    update projections.current_states s
    set
      "position" = b.new_position
    from
      broken b
    where
      s.instance_id = b.instance_id
      and s.projection_name = b.projection_name
      and s.aggregate_id = b.aggregate_id
      and s.aggregate_type = b.aggregate_type
      and s.sequence = b.sequence
  )
select
  b.projection_name,
  b.instance_id,
  b.aggregate_id,
  b.aggregate_type,
  b.sequence,
  b.old_position,
  b.new_position
from
  broken b;
```

If the output from the above looks reasonable, for example not a huge difference between `old_position` and `new_position`, commit the transaction:

```sql
commit;
```

When there are no rows returned, your system was not affected by precision loss.

When there's unexpected output, use `rollback;` instead.
