title: ZITADEL with Java Spring Boot
sidebar_label: Java Spring Boot
---

This integration guide demonstrates the recommended way to incorporate ZITADEL into your Spring Boot web application. 
It explains how to enable user login in your application and how to fetch data from the user info endpoint.

By the end of this guide, your application will have login functionality and will be able to access the current user's profile.

:::info
This documentation references our [example](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java) on GitHub. 
You can either create your own application or directly run the example by providing the necessary arguments.
:::

## Set up application

Before we begin developing our application, we need to perform a few configuration steps in the ZITADEL Console.
You'll need to provide some information about your app. We recommend creating a new app to start from scratch. Navigate to your Project, then add a new application at the top of the page.
Select the **Web** application type and continue.

![Create app in console](/img/java-spring/app-create.png)

We recommend that you use [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](/apis/openidoauth/grant-types#proof-key-for-code-exchange) for all applications.

![Create app in console - set auth method](/img/java-spring/app-create-auth.png)

### Redirect URIs

The Redirect URIs field tells ZITADEL where it's allowed to redirect users after authentication. For development, you can set dev mode to `true` to enable insecure HTTP and redirect to a `localhost` URI.
The Post-logout redirect send the users back to a route on your application after they have logged out.

:::info
If you are following along with the [example](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java), set the dev mode to `true`, the Redirect URIs to `http://localhost:18080/webapp/login/oauth2/code/zitadel` and Post redirect URI to `http://localhost:18080/webapp`.
:::

Continue and create the application.

### Client ID

After successful creation of the app, a pop-up will appear displaying the app's client ID. Copy the client ID, as you will need it to configure your Java client.

![Create app in console - copy client_id](/img/java-spring/app-create-clientid.png)

## Spring setup

Now that you have configured your web application on the ZITADEL side, you can proceed with the integration of your Spring client.
This guide will reference the [example repository](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java) and explain the necessary steps taken in there.
If your starting from scratch, you can use the Spring Initializer with the [following setup](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.2.1&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&dependencies=web,thymeleaf,security,oauth2-client,lombok) as a base.

### Support classes

To be able to take the most out of ZITADELs RBAC, we first need to create a GrantedAuthoritiesMapper, that will map the role claims (`urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:roles`)
into Spring Security `authiorities`, which can be used later on to determine the granted permissions.

So in your application, create a 'support/zitadel' package and in there the `ZitadelGrantedAuthoritiesMapper.java`:

```java reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/java/demo/support/zitadel/ZitadelGrantedAuthoritiesMapper.java
```

The following two classes will provide you the possibility to access and use the user's token for requests to another API, e.g. the Spring Boot API example.

Directly create them in the `support` package.

```java reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/java/demo/support/TokenAccessor.java
```

```java reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/java/demo/support/AccessTokenInterceptor.java
```

### Application server configuration

As we have now our support classes, we can now create and configure the application server (and API client) itself.

In a new `config` package, create first the `WebClientConfig.java`, which will provide a RestTemplate using the previously created AccessTokenInterceptor:

```java reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/java/demo/config/WebClientConfig.java
```

Additionally also create the `WebSecurityConfig.java` in the same package. This class will take care of the authentication, redirecting the user to the login,
mapping the claims (using the ZitadelGrantedAuthoritiesMapper) and also provide the possibility for logout:

```java reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/java/demo/config/WebSecurityConfig.java
```

For the authentication (and the server in general) to work, the application needs some configuration, so please provide the following to your `application.yml` (resources folder):

```yaml reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/resources/application.yml
```

Note that both the `issuer-uri` as well as the `client-id` are only placeholders. You can either change them in here using the values provided by ZITADEL
or pass them later on as arguments when starting the application.

### Add pages to your application

To be able to serve these pages create a `templates` directory in the `resources` folder.
Now create three HTML files in the new `templates` folder and copy the content of the examples:

**index.html**

The home page will display the Userinfo from the authentication context and the granted roles / Spring security authorities.

```html reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/resources/templates/index.html
```

**fragments.html**

The navigation to switch between the home and tasks page and allows the user to logout.

```html reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/resources/templates/fragments.html
```

**tasks.html**

The tasks page allows you to interact with the Spring Boot API example and display / add new tasks.

```html reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/resources/templates/tasks.html
```

**UiController**

To serve these pages and handler their actions, you finally need a `UiController.java`:

```java reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/blob/main/web/src/main/java/demo/web/UiController.java
```

### Start your application

In case you've created your own application and depending on your development setup you might need to build the application first:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

You will need to provide the `issuer-uri` (your ZITADEL domain) and the `client-id` previously created:

```bash
java \
  -Dspring.security.oauth2.client.provider.zitadel.issuer-uri=<see configuration above> \
  -Dspring.security.oauth2.client.registration.zitadel.client-id=<see configuration above> \
  -jar web/target/web-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

This could look like:

```bash
java \
  -Dspring.security.oauth2.client.provider.zitadel.issuer-uri=https://my-domain.zitadel.cloud \
  -Dspring.security.oauth2.client.registration.zitadel.client-id=243861220627644836@example \
  -jar web/target/web-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If you then visit on [http://localhost:18080/webapp](http://localhost:18080/webapp) you should directly be redirected to your ZITADEL instance.
After login with your existing user you will be presented the profile page:

## Completion

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated your Spring Boot web application with ZITADEL!

If you get stuck, consider checking out our [example](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java) application. 
This application includes all the functionalities mentioned in this quickstart. 
You can directly start it with your own configuration. If you face issues, contact us or raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-java/issues).
