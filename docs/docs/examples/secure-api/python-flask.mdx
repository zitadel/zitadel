This example shows you how to secure a Python3 Flask API with both authentication and authorization using ZITADEL.

## Overview

![Overview](/img/python-flask/1.png)


The Python API will have public, private, and private-scoped routes and check if a user is authenticated and authorized to access the routes.
The private routes expect an authorization header with a valid access token in the request. The access token is used as a bearer token to authenticate the user when calling the API.
The API will validate the access token on the [introspect endpoint](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/openidoauth/endpoints#introspection_endpoint) and will receive the user's roles from ZITADEL.

The API application uses [Client Secret Basic](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/openidoauth/authn-methods#client-secret-basic) to authenticate against ZITADEL and access the introspection endpoint.
You can use any valid access_token from a user or service account to send requests to the example API.
In this example we will use a service account with a [personal access token](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/pat) which can be used directly to access the example API.


## Running the example

### Python Prerequisites

In order to run the example you need to have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

### ZITADEL configuration for the API

![Create API application](/img/python-flask/2.png)

You need to setup a couple of things in ZITADEL. 

1. If you don't have an instance yet, please go ahead and create an instance as explained [here](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/start/quickstart#2-create-your-first-instance). Also, create a new project by following the steps [here](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/start/quickstart#2-create-your-first-instance).

2. You must create an API application in your project. Follow [this guide](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/console/applications) to create a new application of type "API" with authentication method "Basic". Save both the ClientID and ClientSecret after you create the application. 

### Create the API

1. Clone or download this [Python project](https://github.com/zitadel/example-api-python3-flask) to your workspace. 

```
git clone https://github.com/zitadel/example-api-python3-flask

cd example-api-python3-flask
```
2. The [server.py](https://github.com/zitadel/example-api-python3-flask/blob/main/server.py) file contains a Flask-based API that provides authentication for routes using the OpenID Connect protocol as shown below.
 

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, Response
from authlib.integrations.flask_oauth2 import ResourceProtector
from validator import ZitadelIntrospectTokenValidator, ValidatorError

require_auth = ResourceProtector()
require_auth.register_token_validator(ZitadelIntrospectTokenValidator())

APP = Flask(__name__)

@APP.errorhandler(ValidatorError)
def handle_auth_error(ex: ValidatorError) -> Response:

    response = jsonify(ex.error)
    response.status_code = ex.status_code
    return response

@APP.route("/api/public")
def public():
    """No access token required."""
    response = (
        "Public route - You don't need to be authenticated to see this."
    )
    return jsonify(message=response)


@APP.route("/api/private")
@require_auth(None)
def private():
    """A valid access token is required."""
    response = (
        "Private route - You need to be authenticated to see this."
    )
    return jsonify(message=response)


@APP.route("/api/private-scoped")
@require_auth(["read:messages"])
def private_scoped():
    """A valid access token and scope are required."""
    response = (
        "Private, scoped route - You need to be authenticated and have the role read:messages to see this."
    )
    return jsonify(message=response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    APP.run()
```

The API has three routes:

<ul>
<li> "/api/public" - No access token is required.</li>
<li>"/api/private" - A valid access token is required.</li>
<li>"/api/private-scoped" - A valid access token and a "read:messages" scope are required.</li>
</ul>

The [validator.py](https://github.com/zitadel/example-api-python3-flask/blob/main/validator.py) file implements the ZitadelIntrospectTokenValidator class, which is a custom class that inherits from the IntrospectTokenValidator class provided by the authlib library. The introspection process retrieves the token details from ZITADEL using ZITADEL's introspection endpoint.

```python
from os import environ as env
import os
import time
from typing import Dict

from authlib.oauth2.rfc7662 import IntrospectTokenValidator
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

load_dotenv()

ZITADEL_DOMAIN = os.getenv("ZITADEL_DOMAIN")
CLIENT_ID = os.getenv("CLIENT_ID")
CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv("CLIENT_SECRET")


class ValidatorError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, error: Dict[str, str], status_code: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.error = error
        self.status_code = status_code

# Use Introspection in Resource Server
# https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/specs/rfc7662.html#require-oauth-introspection

class ZitadelIntrospectTokenValidator(IntrospectTokenValidator):
    def introspect_token(self, token_string):
        url = f'{ZITADEL_DOMAIN}/oauth/v2/introspect'
        data = {'token': token_string, 'token_type_hint': 'access_token', 'scope': 'openid'}
        auth = HTTPBasicAuth(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)
        resp = requests.post(url, data=data, auth=auth)
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return resp.json()
    
    def match_token_scopes(self, token, or_scopes):
        if or_scopes is None: 
            return True
        roles = token["urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:roles"].keys()
        for and_scopes in or_scopes:
            scopes = and_scopes.split()
            """print(f"Check if all {scopes} are in {roles}")"""
            if all(key in roles for key in scopes):
                return True
        return False

    def validate_token(self, token, scopes, request):
        print (f"Token: {token}\n")
        now = int( time.time() )
        if not token:
            raise ValidatorError({
                "code": "invalid_token_revoked", 
                "description": "Token was revoked." }, 401)
        """Expired"""
        if token["exp"] < now: 
            raise ValidatorError({
                "code": "invalid_token_expired", 
                "description": "Token has expired." }, 401)
        """Revoked"""
        if not token["active"]: 
            raise InvalidTokenError()
        """Insufficient Scope"""
        if not self.match_token_scopes(token, scopes):
            raise ValidatorError({
                "code": "insufficient_scope", 
                "description": f"Token has insufficient scope. Route requires: {scopes}" }, 401)

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        res = self.introspect_token(*args, **kwargs)
        return res
```
3. Create a new file named ".env" in the directory. Copy the configuration in the [".env.example"](https://github.com/zitadel/example-api-python3-flask/blob/main/.env.example) file to the newly created .env file. Set the values with your Instance Domain/Issuer URL, Client ID, and Client Secret from the previous steps. Obtain your Issuer URL by following [these steps](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/start/quickstart#referred1).

```python
ZITADEL_DOMAIN = "https://your-domain-abcdef.zitadel.cloud"
CLIENT_ID = "197....@projectname"
CLIENT_SECRET = "NVAp70IqiGmJldbS...."
```

### ZITADEL configuration to create a service user

![Create a service user](/img/python-flask/3.png)

1. Create a service user and a Personal Access Token (PAT) for that user by following [this guide](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/pat#create-a-service-user-with-a-pat). 
2. To enable authorization, follow [this guide](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/console/roles) to create a role `read:messages` on your project. 
3. Next, create an authorization for the service user you created by adding the role `read:messages` to the user. Follow this [guide](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/console/roles#authorizations) for more information on creating an authorization. 


### Run the API

1. Install required dependencies by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` on your terminal.
2. Run the API with the `python3 server.py` command.
3. Open another terminal and follow the next step to test the API.

## Test the API

### Public route

Invoke the public route by running the following command: 

```
curl --request GET \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/public
```

You should get a response with Status Code 200 and the following message.

`{"message":"Public route - You don't need to be authenticated to see this."}`

### Private route

Call the private route without authorization headers by running the following command: 

```
curl --request GET \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/private
```

You should get a response with Status Code 401 and an error message.

Now let's add an authorization header to your request. Save the personal access token for your service user to a variable by running the following command. Replace the value with the PAT you obtained earlier.  

`PAT=nr9vnUTkQkn4rxWk...`

Then call the private route with the PAT in the authorization header.

```
curl --request GET \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/private \
    --header "authorization: Bearer $PAT"
```

Now you should get a response with Status Code 200 and the following message.

`{"message":"Private route - You need to be authenticated to see this."}`

### Private route, protected

Call the private route that requires the user to have a certain role

```
curl --request GET \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/private-scoped \
    --header "authorization: Bearer $PAT"
```

You should get a response with Status Code 200 and the following message. 

`{"message":"Private, scoped route - You need to be authenticated and have the role read:messages to see this."}`

You can remove the role from the service user in ZITADEL and try again. You should then get a Status Code 403, Forbidden error.
