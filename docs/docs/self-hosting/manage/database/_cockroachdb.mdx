## Zitadel v2 with Cockroach

:::warning
Zitadel v3 removed CockroachDB support. See the [CLI mirror guide](../cli/mirror) for migrating to PostgreSQL.
:::

The default database of Zitadel v2 is [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com). The SQL database provides a bunch of features like horizontal scalability, data regionality and many more.

Currently versions >= 25.1 are supported.

The default configuration of the database looks like this:

```yaml

  cockroach:
    Host: localhost
    Port: 26257
    Database: zitadel
