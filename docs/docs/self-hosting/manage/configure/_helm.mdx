For running Zitadel on Kubernetes, use the Helm chart provided by Zitadel.
The configuration is passed as native Helm values.
Also, secrets are passed as native Helm values with the option to let Helm manage a Kubernetes secret to do so.
You also have the option to pass secret configuration managed outside of Helm in existing Kubernetes secrets to the Zitadel Helm chart.
Among other examples, you find the [example with referenced secrets](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-charts/tree/main/examples/3-referenced-secrets) in the charts /examples folder.
If you want to just get started easily, follow the [example with an insecure Postgres](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-charts/tree/main/examples/3-referenced-secrets).
