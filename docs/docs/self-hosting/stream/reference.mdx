By default, all stream records have flat properties.
This makes them easy to access in any log collection rule.
Also, it allows to map record fields directly to easily accessible database columns.

For example, an request_http stream record could look like this:

<details open>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <CodeBlock language="js">{Example}</CodeBlock>
</details>

## Schema Evolution

The log records schemas are defined in Protobuf, so that strict types and structures can be guaranteed.
If a streams schema is changed in a backward incompatible way, its version is bumped.
The Zitadel runtime configuration allows to pin the written streams versions.
This allows downstream tools to update their code before new stream versions are produced.

## Base Stream Record

The following baseStreamRecord shows which fields are potentially set in all stream records.
The properties "stream" and "version" define what additional fields are potentially available in the record.
Possible values for "stream":

- [request_grpc](#request_grpc)
- [request_http](#request_http)
- [runtime_version](#runtime_version)
- [runtime_service](#runtime_service)
- [action_targetcall](#action_targetcall)
- [action_trigger_grpc_request](#action_trigger_grpc_request)
- [action_trigger_grpc_response](#action_trigger_grpc_response)
- [action_trigger_event](#action_trigger_event)
- [action_trigger_function](#action_trigger_function)
- [event](#event)
- [notification](#notification)
