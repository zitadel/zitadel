Zitadel by default writes [structured stream records](/docs/self-hosting/stream/schema) to its processes standard error file.
You can make use of this if you would like to:
- [Debug runtime or user errors](/docs/self-hosting/stream/debugging)
- [Analyze usage or bill your customers](/docs/self-hosting/stream/analytics)
- [Accelerate your auditing processes](/docs/self-hosting/stream/auditing)
- [Run a custom forward and backward compatible handler for type safe records](/docs/self-hosting/stream/integrations)

[Configure specific streams](/docs/self-hosting/stream/config) to make them fit into your ecosystem.

## Out-of-scope: Runtime Observability

For runtime observability, rather use Zitadels metrics endpoint.
If you use the official Zitadel Helm chart, you can enable alerts on predefined service level indicators and objectives for sloth.
This feature is under construction :construction:
