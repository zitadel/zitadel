title: Set up Zitadel with Docker Compose
sidebar_label: Docker Compose
---

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import DockerComposeSource from '!!raw-loader!./docker-compose.yaml'
import Disclaimer from './_disclaimer.mdx'
import DefaultUser from './_defaultuser.mdx'
import Next from './_next.mdx'
import NoteInstanceNotFound from './troubleshooting/_note_instance_not_found.mdx';


The setup is tested against Docker version 28.3.2 and Docker Compose version v2.38.2

## Docker compose

By executing the commands below, you will download the following file:

<details>
    <summary>docker-compose.yaml</summary>
    <CodeBlock language="yaml">{DockerComposeSource}</CodeBlock>
</details>

```bash
# Download the docker compose example configuration.
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zitadel/zitadel/main/docs/docs/self-hosting/deploy/docker-compose.yaml

# Make sure you have the latest image versions
docker compose pull

# Run the PostgreSQL database, the Zitadel API and the Zitadel login.
docker compose up
```


## What's next

This guide is for development / demonstration purpose only and does NOT reflect a production setup.
To go from here to production, read the [Zitadel Production Setup Guide](/self-hosting/manage/production).

These are the most common steps forward:
- **Read the comments in the docker-compose.yaml**: The comments give context to the used variables and show examples for commonly used configuration.
- **Understand your configuration options**: Learn how to [configure your platform](/self-hosting/manage/configure)
- **Serve the API and the UI together on the same port**: [Run and configure your favorite reverse proxy](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/reverse_proxy)
- **Configure a different external domain or IP**: Beware that the login does not work with HTTP on non-localhost domains. [Run and configure your favorite reverse proxy](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/reverse_proxy)
- **Encrypt Traffic**: [Run and configure your favorite reverse proxy](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/reverse_proxy)
- **Enable end-to-end gRPC-web support**: [Run and configure your favorite reverse proxy](/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/reverse_proxy)
- **Enable the login v2 on existing installations**:
  1. Read the login v2 related comments in the docker-compose.yaml. 
  1. [Manually create a login client personal access token (PAT) for the now running v2 login](/self-hosting/manage/login-client#create-login-client).
  1. Move the PAT to `./login-client.pat`
  1. Restart the login process: `docker compose restart login`
  1. [Enable the Login UI for all users](/self-hosting/manage/login-client#require-login-v2)
