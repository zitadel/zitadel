This guide is the entrypoint for running the Zitadel platform locally for the first time. 
It is for demonstration and development purposes only and does not set up a production-ready and security hardened instance of Zitadel.
Once Zitadel up is and running, learn more about a production setup in the [What's Next section](#next-steps).

## Prerequisites

The setup is likely to work with other software versions too, but it is tested against the following environment:

- Ubuntu 24.04.1
- Docker 28.3.2
- Docker Compose v2.38.2
- curl 8.5.0

## Docker compose

The following commands set up services for a PostgreSQL database, a Zitadel API and a Zitadel login:

1. Download the `docker-compose.yaml` file from the Zitadel repository:
   ```shell
   curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zitadel/zitadel/main/docs/docs/self-hosting/deploy/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
   ```
2. Make sure the containers use the latest image versions.
    ```shell
    docker compose pull
    ```
3. Run the PostgreSQL database, the Zitadel API, and the Zitadel login.
    ```shell
    docker compose up --detach --wait
    ```
4. Verify the containers are running and healthy.
    ```shell
    docker compose ps
    ```

## What's next{#next-steps}

Before proceeding, review the downloaded `docker-compose.yaml` file:
The comments give context to the used variables and show examples for commonly used configuration variants.

Here are some natural steps forward to go from the current setup to production:

- **Use a different master key**: Set up an instance from scratch and use a different master key. For example, generate one by running `tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 32`
- **Use files for secrets instead of environment variables, and don't commit them to Git**: Learn how to [configure the platform](/docs/self-hosting/manage/configure). For containerized deployments, consider using [Docker secrets support](/docs/self-hosting/manage/configure/configure#docker-secrets-support) for enhanced security.
- **Run the containers as non-root users**: Remove the `user: "0"` lines from the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- **Configure a different external domain or IP**: Beware that the login only works with HTTPS on non-localhost domains. [Run and configure a reverse proxy](/docs/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/reverse_proxy)
- **Serve the API and the UI together on the same port**: [Run and configure a reverse proxy](/docs/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/reverse_proxy)
- **Encrypt Traffic**: [Run and configure a reverse proxy](/docs/self-hosting/manage/reverseproxy/reverse_proxy)

    <summary>Read this if the environment uses the login v1</summary>
    <p>
        The login v2 is the next generation of the Zitadel login.
        Its code and deployment are easily customizable.
        Unlike the login v1, it runs in its own process.
        The login v2 is enabled by default in new installations.
        But if an existing `docker-compose.yaml` file is updated by following this guide,
        an additional `zitadel-login` service is now running which is actually not doing anything, yet.
        The following steps give guidance on how to enable the login v2 in an environment.
