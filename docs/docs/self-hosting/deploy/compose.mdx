This guide is the entrypoint for running the Zitadel platform locally for the first time. 
It is for demonstration and development purposes only and does not set up a production-ready and security hardened instance of Zitadel.
Once Zitadel up is and running, learn more about a production setup in the [What's Next section](#next-steps).

- [ ] TODO: Align with Linux example. Maybe use getting started and to production tabs. Maybe link to linux examnple as a reference.  

## Prerequisites

The setup is likely to work with other software versions too, but it is tested against the following environment:

- Ubuntu 24.04.1
- Darwin 15.6.1
- Docker 28.5.1
- Docker Compose v2.40.3-desktop.1
- curl 8.5.0

## Docker compose

The following commands set up services for a PostgreSQL database, a Zitadel API and a Zitadel login:

1. Download the `docker-compose.yaml` file from the Zitadel repository:
   ```shell
   curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zitadel/zitadel/main/docs/docs/self-hosting/deploy/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
   ```
2. Make sure the containers use the latest image versions.
    ```shell
    docker compose pull
    ```
3. Generate an RSA key pair and run PostgreSQL database, the Zitadel API with the public RSA key, and the Zitadel login with the private RSA key.
    ```shell
    docker compose up --detach --wait
    ```
4. Verify the containers are running and healthy.
    ```shell
    docker compose ps
    ```

## What's next{#next-steps}

Before proceeding, review the downloaded `docker-compose.yaml` file:
The comments give context to the used variables and show examples for commonly used configuration variants.

    <summary>Read this if your current environment uses the Login v1</summary>
    <p>
        The Login v2 is the next generation of the Zitadel login.
        Its code and deployment are easily customizable.
        Unlike the Login v1, it runs in its own process.
        The Login v2 is enabled by default in new installations.
        But if an existing `docker-compose.yaml` file is updated by following this guide,
        an additional `zitadel-login` service is now running which is actually not doing anything, yet.
        The following steps give guidance on how to enable the login v2 in an environment.
