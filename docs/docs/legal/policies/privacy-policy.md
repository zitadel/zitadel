## General notes

Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection provisions of the Swiss Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG), every person has the right to protection of their privacy as well as protection against misuse of their personal data. The operators of these websites and services take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data protection regulations as well as this data protection declaration.

In cooperation with our suppliers, we make every effort to protect the databases and any of our users data as well as possible against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or falsification. We point out that data transmission over the internet in general may result in security risks. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.

This website uses TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as requests that you send to us as the website operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://".

## Processing of personal data, legal basis, storage period

**Personal data** is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable person. A **data subject** is a person about whom personal data is processed. Processing includes any handling of personal data, regardless of the means and procedures used, in particular the storage, disclosure, acquisition, deletion, storage, modification, destruction and use of personal data.

We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law. In addition, we process - to the extent and insofar as the EU Data Protection Regulation is applicable - personal data in accordance with the following legal bases within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) DSGVO :

* Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing operations, Art. 6 (1) a) DSGVO serves as the legal basis.
* When processing personal data for the fulfillment of a contract with the data subject as well as for the implementation of corresponding pre-contractual measures, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO serves as the legal basis.
* To the extent that processing of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject under any applicable law of the EU or under any applicable law of a country in which the GDPR applies in whole or in part, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.
* For the processing of personal data in order to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d DSGVO serves as the legal basis.
* If personal data is processed in order to protect the legitimate interests of us or of third parties and if the fundamental freedoms and rights and interests of the data subject do not override our interests and the interests of third parties, Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis. Legitimate interests are in particular our business interest in being able to provide our website and our products, information security, the enforcement of our own legal claims and compliance with Swiss law.

We will retain personal data for the period of time necessary for the particular purpose for which it was collected and where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). Subsequently, they are either deleted or made anonymous, unless we need them for a longer period of time in exceptional cases, e.g. due to legal storage and documentation obligations or our legitimate interests, such as the protection of rights to which we are entitled or the defense of claims. 

### Processing of personal data when using the website, contact forms and in connection with newsletters

Our websites can generally be visited without registration. Each time one of our website is requested, data such as content of the requested page, name of the requested file, IP address, date and time are automatically stored in log files on the server.

This data is processed to enable correct delivery and functioning of the website. In addition, we use the data to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our systems.

Personal data, in particular name, address or e-mail address are collected as far as possible on a voluntary basis, for example when you contact us via a contact form or by e-mail. Without your consent, the data will not be passed on to third parties, unless otherwise stated in this privacy policy.

If you send us inquiries via contact form, your data from the form, including any data you provided, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent, except insofar as this is shown in this privacy policy.

If you would like to receive newsletters offered on our Sites, we require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified e-mail address and agree to receive the newsletter. Further data will not be collected. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties, except as described in this privacy policy.

You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and their use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe link" in the newsletter.

### Processing of personal data when applying for a job with us

Our Sites can generally be visited without registration. If you apply for a job with us, we may collect and process according to the [Privacy policy for the ZITADEL employer branding and recruitment](https://jobs.zitadel.com/privacy-policy). You may request and delete your data with the links on our [data & privacy page](https://jobs.zitadel.com/data-privacy).

In particular, the following personal data are part of the processing:

import { PiiTable } from "../../../src/components/pii_table";

<PiiTable />

Unless otherwise mentioned, the nature and purpose of the processing is as follows:

The data is uploaded by customers in our Services or collected by us based on requests from users. The personal data is processed by us exclusively for the provision of the requested Services or the use of the agreed Services.

The fulfillment of the contract includes in particular, but is not limited to, the processing of personal data for the purpose of:

* Authentication and authorization of users

## Disclosure to third parties

### Third party sub-processors

We use third-party services to provide the website and our offers. An up-to-date list of all the providers we use and their areas of activity can be found on our [Trust Center](/trust).

### External payment providers

This Site uses external payment service providers through whose platforms users and we can make payment transactions. For example, via [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ch/privacy).

As an alternative, we offer customers the option to pay by invoice instead of using external payment providers. However, this may require a positive credit check in advance.

The data processed by the payment service providers includes personal data, such as the name and address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and checksums, as well as the contract, totals and recipient-related information. The information is necessary to carry out the transactions. However, the data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored with them. We as the operator do not receive any information about (bank) account or credit card, but only information to confirm (accept) or reject the payment. Under certain circumstances, the data is transmitted by the payment service providers to credit agencies. The purpose of this transmission is to check the identity and creditworthiness of the payment service provider. In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and data protection information of the payment service providers.

For payment transactions, the terms and conditions and the data protection notices of the respective payment service providers apply, which can be accessed within the respective website or transaction applications. We also refer to these for the purpose of further information and assertion of revocation, information and other rights concerned.

### Law enforcement

We disclose personal data to law enforcement agencies, investigative authorities or in legal proceedings to the extent we are required to do so by law or when necessary to protect our rights or the rights of users.

## Cookies

Our Sites use cookies. These are small text files that make it possible to store specific information related to the user on the user's terminal device while the user is using the website.

Cookies remain stored beyond the end of a browser session and can be retrieved when the user visits the site again.

When you use our Services, we may collect information about your visit, including via cookies, beacons, invisible tags, and similar technologies (collectively “cookies”) in your browser and on emails sent to you. This information may include personal data, such as your IP address, web browser, device type, and the web pages that you visit just before or just after you use the Services, as well as information about your interactions with the Services, such as the date and time of your visit, and where you have clicked.

### Necessary cookies

We also use cookies for website analytics purposes in order to operate, maintain, and improve the Services for you. We use Google Analytics 4 and PostHog to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf. Google Analytics and PostHog helps us understand how you engage with the Services and may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources.

You can learn about the analytics providers' practices by going to

## How we protect personal data

Personal data is maintained on our servers or those of our service providers, and is accessible by authorized employees, representatives, and agents as necessary for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

We maintain a range of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to help protect personal data. While we attempt to protect your personal data in our possession, we cannot guarantee at all times the security of the data as no method of transmission over the internet or security system is perfect.

If you choose to remain logged in, you should be aware that anyone with access to your device will be able to access your account and we therefore strongly recommend that you take appropriate steps to protect against unauthorized access to, and use, of your account. Please also notify us as soon as possible if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or password.

## Note on international data transfers

Our Sites and Services make use of tools from companies based in countries outside of Switzerland or the EU/EEA, namely those based in the USA. When these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to the servers of the respective companies abroad. If you are using the Site or Services from outside the United States, your personal data may be processed in a foreign country, where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country. In these cases, we only transfer personal data after we have implemented the legally required measures for this, such as concluding standard contractual clauses on data protection or obtaining the consent of the data subjects. If interested, the documentation on these measures can be obtained from the contact person mentioned above. By submitting your personal data to us you agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal data in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States.

We actively try to minimize the use of tools from companies located in countries without equivalent data protection, however, due to the lack of alternatives, this is currently not always feasible without major inconvenience. If you have any concerns, please contact us directly and we will try to find a mutual solution for your needs.

## Children's Privacy

Our Site is not intended for or directed to children under the age of 14. We do not knowingly collect personal data directly from children under the age of 14 without parental consent.
