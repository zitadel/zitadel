## Processing of Personal Data

This DPA applies where and only to the extent that ZITADEL processes Customer Personal Data in connection with the provision of the Services under the Agreement involving the processing of Personal Data protected by Applicable Data Protection Law.
This DPA reflects the commitment of both Parties to abide by Applicable Data Protection Law for the processing of Personal Data by ZITADEL as a processor for the purpose of the ZITADEL's provision of the Services and its execution of the Agreement.

import { PiiTable } from "../../src/components/pii_table";

<PiiTable />

## Scope

Under this Agreement, ZITADEL shall process Customer Personal Data to perform its obligations under the Agreement and and strictly in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer (the “**Permitted Purpose**”), except where otherwise required by law(s) that are not incompatible with Applicable Data Protection Law.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of this DPA, the Customer is the controller and appoints ZITADEL as a processor to process the Customer Personal Data.
To the extent that the Parties are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the Customer is the business whereas ZITADEL is a service provider to the Customer.
Each Party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Data Protection Law.

Each Party shall comply with its own obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law in respect of any Customer Personal Data processed under the Agreement.

## Customer's Responsibilities

The Customer’s instructions to ZITADEL shall comply with Applicable Data Protection Law.
The Customer will have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality and legality of the Customer Data, the means by which the Customer acquired the Customer Data, and the Customer's permissions to process the Customer Data pursuant to this DPA.

As required under Applicable Data Protection Law, the Customer will provide all necessary notices to data subjects and secure the applicable lawful grounds for processing Data under the DPA, including where applicable, all necessary permissions and consents from them. To the extent required under Applicable Data Protection Law, the Customer will receive and document the appropriate consent from the data subject(s).

The Customer represents and warrants that (i) it complies with Applicable Data Protection Law as relevant to the lawful processing by ZITADEL of Customer Personal Data for the purposes contemplated by this DPA and the Agreement; and (ii) to the knowledge of the Customer, the processing of Customer Personal Data by ZITADEL in accordance with the Customer’s instructions will not cause ZITADEL to be in breach of any Applicable Data Protection Law.

The Customer shall not disclose any special categories of Personal Data or sensitive personal information (as these terms are defined under Applicable Data Protection Law) to ZITADEL for processing.

## Obligations of the processor

### Bound by the Customer's directions and instructions

Customer hereby instructs ZITADEL to process Customer Data for the Permitted Purpose.

ZITADEL processes Personal Data in accordance with its privacy policy (cf. [Privacy Policy](./policies/privacy-policy)) and upon the documented directions of the Customer (which includes the Agreement).
Subsequent instructions shall be given either in writing, whereby e-mail shall suffice, or orally with immediate written confirmation.

ZITADEL shall promptly inform Customer if it becomes aware that such processing instructions infringe Applicable Data Protection Law (but without obligation to actively monitor compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law).
In such case, ZITADEL shall be entitled to suspend the processing until the infringing instruction is withdrawn or confirmed.

### Confidentiality obligations

ZITADEL shall ensure that any person that it authorises to process Customer Data (including ZITADEL’s staff, agents and sub-processors) (an “Authorised Person”) shall be subject to a strict duty of confidentiality (whether a contractual duty or a statutory duty) and shall not permit any person to process the Customer Data that is not under such a duty of confidentiality. 
ZITADEL shall ensure that all Authorised Persons process the Customer Data only as necessary for the Permitted Purpose.

### Technical and organizational measures

ZITADEL shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the Customer Data from a Security Incident, as described in Annex II to this DPA.
Such measures shall comply with all Applicable Data Protection Law and shall further have regard to the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
The Customer acknowledges that such measures are subject to technical progress and development and that ZITADEL may update or modify such measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not degrade or diminish overall security of the Customer Data, or of the Services under the Agreement.

### Involvement of subcontracted processors

Customer agrees that ZITADEL may engage sub-processors to process Customer Data on Customer’s behalf. A current and complete [list of involved and approved sub-processors](https://zitadel.com/trust) can be found on our [Trust Center](https://zitadel.com/trust) (as may be updated from time to time in accordance with this DPA).

ZITADEL will notify Customer by updating the list of sub-processors and, if Customer has subscribed to notices, via email.
If, within five (5) calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies ZITADEL in writing that Customer objects to ZITADEL's appointment of a new sub-processor based on reasonable data protection concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution.
If the parties are not able to mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for convenience with no refunds and Customer will remain liable to pay any committed fees in an order form, order, statement of work or other similar ordering document.

ZITADEL shall inform the Customer if it adds or replaces any sub-processor at least fifteen (15) days prior to any such change (including details of the processing it performs or will perform).
The Customer may object in writing to ZITADEL’s engagement of a new sub-processor on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Customer Personal Data by notifying ZITADEL promptly in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of ZITADEL’s notice.
In such case, the parties shall discuss Customer’s concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution.
If such objection right is not exercised by Customer, silence shall be deemed to constitute an approval of the relevant sub-processor engagement.

Where ZITADEL appoints a sub-processor, ZITADEL shall: (i) enter into a written agreement with each sub-processor containing data protection terms that provide at least the same level of protection for Customer Data as those contained in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such sub-processor; and (ii) remain responsible to the Customer for ZITADEL’s sub-processors’ failure to perform their obligations with respect to the processing of Customer Data.

Taking into account the safeguards set forth in this DPA, Customer Data may be processed outside of Switzerland or the EU/EAA, such as in the United States or any country in which ZITADEL or is sub-processors operate. Our [list of involved and approved sub-processors](https://zitadel.com/trust) provides additional details.

### Assistance in responding to requests

ZITADEL shall provide all reasonable and timely assistance (which may include by appropriate technical and organisational measures) to the Customer to enable the Customer to respond to: (i) any request from a data subject to exercise any of their rights under Applicable Data Protection Law ("**Data Subject Request**"); and (ii) any other correspondence, enquiry or complaint received from a data subject, regulator or other third party in connection with the processing of Customer Personal Data.

In the event that any such request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint is made directly to ZITADEL, ZITADEL shall promptly inform the Customer providing full details of the same.
ZITADEL will not respond to a Data Subject Request, however the Customer acknowledges and agrees that ZITADEL may at its discretion respond to confirm that such request relates to the Customer.

The Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Services include features which will allow the Customer to manage Data Subject Requests directly through the Services without additional assistance from the Processor.
If the Customer does not have the ability to address a Data Subject Request, ZITADEL will, upon the Customer’s written request, provide reasonable assistance to facilitate the Customer’s response to such Data Subject Request to the extent such assistance is consistent with Applicable Data Protection Law; provided that the Customer will be responsible for paying for any reasonable costs incurred or fees charged by ZITADEL for providing such assistance.

ZITADEL, unless prohibited from doing so by applicable law, will promptly notify the Customer of any requests from a regulator, law enforcement authority or any other relevant and competent authority in relation to the Customer Personal Data that is being processed on behalf of the Customer, to the extent that the request may result in the disclosure of Customer Personal Data to such regulator, law enforcement authority or any other relevant and competent authority.

### Cooperation and support for the Customer

ZITADEL shall provide the Customer with all such reasonable and timely assistance as Customer may require in order to enable it to conduct a data protection impact assessment (or equivalent document) where required by Applicable Data Protection Law, including, if necessary, to assist Customer to consult with its relevant data protection or other regulatory authority.

### Security incidents

Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, ZITADEL shall inform Customer without undue delay and provide all such timely information and cooperation as Customer may require for the Customer to fulfil its data breach or cybersecurity incident reporting obligations under (and in accordance with the timescales required by) Applicable Data Protection Law.
Customer shall further take all such measures and actions as are reasonable and necessary to investigate, contain, and remediate or mitigate the effects of the Security Incident, to the extent that the remediation is within ZITADEL's control, and shall keep Customer informed of all material developments in connection with the Security Incident.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, ZITADEL's notification of or response to a Security Incident under this section will not be construed as an acknowledgment by ZITADEL of any fault or liability with respect to such Security Incident.

### Deletion or destruction after termination

Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, ZITADEL shall (at the Customer’s election) destroy or return to the Customer all Customer Data (including all copies of the Customer Data) in its possession or control (including any Customer Data subcontracted to a third party for processing).
This requirement shall not apply to the extent that ZITADEL is required by any applicable law to retain some or all Customer Data, in which case ZITADEL shall isolate and protect the Customer Data from any further processing except to the extent required by such law until deletion is possible.

### Customer's information and audit rights

To the extent required under Applicable Data Protection Law and on written request from the Customer, ZITADEL shall provide written responses (which may include audit report summaries/extracts) to all reasonable requests for information made by the Customer related to its processing of Customer Personal Data as necessary to confirm ZITADEL's compliance with this DPA.
The Customer shall not exercise this right more than once in any twelve (12)-month rolling period, except (i) if and when required by instruction of a competent data protection or other regulatory authority; or (ii) if ZITADEL has experienced a Security Incident.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to require ZITADEL to document or provide: (i) trade secrets or any proprietary information; (ii) any information that would violate ZITADEL’s confidentiality obligations, contractual obligations, or applicable law; or (iii) any information, the disclosure of which could threaten, compromise, or otherwise put at risk the security, confidentiality, or integrity of ZITADEL’s infrastructure, networks, systems, algorithms or data.

### Service Optimization

Where permitted by Applicable Data Protection Law, ZITADEL may process Customer Data: (i) for its internal uses to build or improve the quality of its services; (ii) to detect Security Incidents; and (iii) to protect against fraudulent or illegal activity.

ZITADEL may: (i) compile aggregated and/or de-identified information in connection with the provision of the Services, provided that such information cannot reasonably be used to identify Customer or any data subject to whom Customer Personal Data relates (“Aggregated and/or De-Identified Data”); and (ii) use such Aggregated and/or De-Identified Data for its lawful business purposes in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law.

### Data Transfers

Where either Party intends to transfer Personal Data cross-border and Applicable Data Protection Law requires certain measures to be implemented prior to such transfer, each Party agrees to implement such measures to ensure compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law.  

To the extent that the transfer of Personal Data from Customer to ZITADEL involves a transfer of Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom to a jurisdiction which is not subject to an adequacy determination by the European Commission, United Kingdom or Swiss authorities (as applicable) that covers such transfer, then the SCCs are hereby incorporated by reference and form an integral part of the Addendum.

#### Swiss Transfers

To the extent that Customer Personal Data is subject to Swiss law, and the transfer would be a Restricted Transfer, the SCCs apply as set out above with the following modifications:

1) references to ‘Regulation (EU) 2016/679’ are interpreted as references to the Swiss FADP or any successor thereof;  
2) references to specific articles of ‘Regulation (EU) 2016/679’ are replaced with the equivalent article or section of the Swiss FADP,  
3) references to ‘EU’, ‘Union’ and ‘Member State’ are replaced with ‘Switzerland’,

5) references to the ‘competent supervisory authority’ and ‘competent courts’ are replaced with the FDPIC and ‘competent Swiss courts’,  
6) in Clause 17, the SCCs are governed by the laws of Switzerland,

1) in Table 1, the details of the parties are set out in the Agreement or, if not set out therein, the applicable statement of work;  
2) in Table 2, the selected modules and clauses are set out in Section 6.3 of this Addendum;

4) in Table 4, the ‘Exporter’ is selected.

#### Alternative Transfer Mechanism

In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction or supervisory authority orders (for whatever reason) that the measures described in this DPA cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer Customer Personal Data, or ZITADEL adopts an alternative data transfer mechanism to the mechanisms described in this DPA, including any new version of or successor to the standard contractual clauses (“Alternative Transfer Mechanism”), the Customer agrees to fully co-operate with ZITADEL to agree an amendment to this Addendum and/or execute such other documents and take such other actions as may be necessary to remedy such non-compliance or give legal effect to such Alternative Transfer Mechanism.
