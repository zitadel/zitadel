ZITADEL will review the case information and determine the severity level (see below), working with the customer to assess the urgency of the request and use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests within the initial response time.

ZITADEL will use reasonable efforts to resolve support request as defined below, but does not guarantee a workaround, resolution or resolution time.

**Severity 3**<br/>Standard support request| <p>Partial and non-critical loss of ZITADEL software functionality or major software defect, yet a workaround exists for viable long-term operation.</p><p>ZITADEL will continue to work on developing permanent resolution.</p>
