## Support

### Support request

ZITADEL agrees to handle support incidents in the following scenarios:

1. Service, product or configuration as provided by ZITADEL contains errors or critical security-related issues
2. Service or product requires upgrades or changes through the customer
3. Service or product has incorrect or missing documentation

Support features include:

- Assist in troubleshooting of issues to isolate potential root cause
- Document and advise alternative solutions for reported defects

Excluded are broader consulting & customer-specific engineering requests regarding use of our products and services. Moreover support requests from Customer’s end users must be handled by the Customer directly.

### Support service process

The customer may submit support requests (“ticket”) through any means of eligible communication channels, consisting of

- Single discrete problem, issue, or request
- Initial severity level and impact statement for assessment
- Description of the issue and if possible a description of the observed and expected behavior,  steps to reproduce the issue, evidence that issue is not caused by connectivity / compute, relevant anonymized log-files etc.
- All information requested by ZITADEL as we resolve the ticket (e.g. system logs)

ZITADEL will review the case information and determine the severity level (see below), working with the customer to assess the urgency of the request and use reasonable efforts to respond to support requests within the initial response time.

ZITADEL will use reasonable efforts to resolve support request as defined below, but does not guarantee a workaround, resolution or resolution time.

Severity Level | Description
--- | --- 
**Severity 1**<br/> Critical / Service down| <p>Widespread failure or complete unavailability of ZITADEL Core Services. </p><p> ZITADEL will use continuous effort to provide a workaround or permanent solution. When Core Services are available, the severity will be lowered to the new appropriate level.</p>
**Severity 2**<br/> Core functionality unavailable or severely degraded| <p>Core Services of ZITADEL software continue to operate in severely restricted fashion, yet long-term productivity may be impacted.</p><p> When Core Services are no longer severely degraded (eg, through a viable workaround or release), the severity level will be lowered to Severity 3.</p>
**Severity 3**<br/>Standard support request| <p>Partial and non-critical loss of ZITADEL software functionality or major software defect, yet a workaround exists for viable long-term operation.</p><p>ZITADEL will continue to work on developing permanent resolution.</p>
**Severity 4**<br/>Non-urgent request| <p>Defined as follows: <ul><li>Request for information or general query</li><li>Feature request</li><li>Performance issues and little to none functional impact</li><li>Defects with workarounds and little to low functional impact</li></ul></p>
<p>ZITADEL will continue to work on developing permanent resolution and response to general requests. ZITADEL does not provide a timeline or guarantee to include any feature requests.</p>

### Escalation

The customer may escalate support requests following the escalation process:

1. For non-urgent needs, the client may request management escalation within the ticket. A manager will review the request and provide a response within one business day.
2. For urgent needs, the client may escalate directly by calling +41 43 456 84 69 and emailing to [hi@zitadel.com](mailto:hi@zitadel.com). A manager will review the request and provide response within two business hours.

If we fail to provide a response to the escalation, you will be entitled to service credits. For every 15 minutes exceeding the state objective, 1 day will be added as extension to the current term.
