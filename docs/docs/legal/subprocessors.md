In order to achieve the best possible transparency we publish which sub-processors and services we use to provide ZITADEL and related services.
The table shows what activity each entity performs.
More information about each activity is provided directly below.
This explains the limited processing of customer data the entity is authorized to perform.

We regularly audit all data processing agreements that we have with our sub-processors to guarantee that they adhere to the same level of privacy as ours to protect your personal data.

You can find [the full list of sub-processors in our trust center](https://trust.zitadel.com/subprocessors). We try to minimize the number of sub-processors that handle end-user data on our behalf to reduce any vendor related risks.
Some providers are used by default, but you can opt-out of the default provide and replace the sub-processor by a provider of your choice.
