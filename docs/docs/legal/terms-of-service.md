## General

### Introduction

CAOS Ltd. (**"We"**, **CAOS AG**, or simply **CAOS**), with head office in Teufener Strasse 19, 9000 St. Gallen, Switzerland, offers "Identity and Access Management as service" with the brand name "ZITADEL Cloud Services" and all of our Websites (**Services** or **ZITADEL Cloud**).

The customer relationship (**Framework Agreement** or **The Agreement**) is created by the **Customer** (**&quot;you&quot;**) by creating a user or organisation within the ZITADEL Cloud Service. On the basis of this Framework Agreement you may then choose to make use of payable services (**Subscription**) as you wish, i.e. you may book services, options and packages yourself at any time (**Booking**) and subsequently terminate them.

The terms of service (**"TOS"**) outlined in this document establish the most important points of this Framework Agreement – independently of the use of any services.

This Agreement has the following appendices. When you enter the Agreement with us, you accept these agreements.

* [**Data Processing Agreement**](data-processing-agreement) - How we process personal data on behalf of you
* [**Service Level Description**](service-level-description) - What service levels do we guarantee you
* [**Support Service Descriptions**](support-services) - How we provide support services to you

The following policies complement the TOS. When accepting the TOS, you accept these policies.

* [**Privacy Policy**](privacy-policy) - How we process personal data on our websites and products
* [**Acceptable Use Policy**](acceptable-use-policy) - What we understand as acceptable and fair use of our Services
* [**Rate Limit Policy**](rate-limit-policy) - How we avoid overloads of our services

### Alterations

Any provisions which deviate from these TOS must be agreed in writing between the Customer and us. Such agreements shall take precedence over the TOS outlined in this document.

### Transfer

You may only transfer the Framework Agreement or Services used in the context of the Framework Agreement to third parties with our prior written consent.

## Our Services

### Type and scope of the services

We provide the Services under the conditions stated on our websites at the time of booking.

### Modifications of services offered

We are entitled to offer new services, to withdraw existing services (**Termination**) or to modify the specifications and prices of existing services (**Modification**) at any time. If the modification or termination affects a service that you are using at that time, we will inform you via email that said service will be automatically modified and/or is no longer available after a period of 30 days.

### Modification of services booked by you

You may change or terminate Services or Subscriptions booked by you at any time. You may, where applicable, add more Services (e.g. add-ons) to your existing Services at any time.

### Due care

We take all appropriate physical and electronic precautions to ensure the security and availability of our infrastructure and the service offered thereupon, in particular to protect against unauthorized access to data, data loss, failures and misuse.

The [Annex of the data processing agreement](data-processing-agreement#annex-regarding-security-measures) outlines the measures we take in more detail.

### Support

We offer Support Services directly related to the use of our Services. The Description of Support Services is available as [Annex](support-services) to this document.

Customers without a Subscription or a Subscription plan that does not include Support Services should post inquiries and issues regarding ZITADEL from customers to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/caos/zitadel/discussions), whenever feasible.

If you need support integrating or setting up ZITADEL, please contact our consulting team.

### Limited influence

Be advised that the scope of our influence is limited. For example, the actual accessibility of a service is also dependent on the connection to and between various Internet Service Providers (&quot;ISPs&quot;). Portions of our services, i.e. software components, may also be beyond our influence and be subject to their own contractual conditions. You accept that in such cases we reject any responsibility.

### Service level

Customers with a Subscription may be eligible for a SLA as outlined in our [Service Level Description](service-level-description).

### Inclusion of third parties

We may include third parties in the provision of our services. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy) and our [Data Processing Agreement](data-processing-agreement) for more information.

## Your obligations

At our request you will provide your truthful contact information and keep it updated at all times. You must also ensure that you actually receive messages, in particular emails, intended for you.

You will ensure that the use of our Websites and Services by you or third parties complies with all applicable legislation, these these TOS, and our [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy) at all times.

### Security

You will take appropriate measures to prevent any misuse of the services you booked. These include, for example, securing the software used and the prompt installation of security updates as well as using suitably secure passwords.

### Disaster recovery

We take care of the necessary disaster recovery measures. The goal is to maintain a maximum 24h old restore point off all the vital data.

Any liability for damages, indirect or direct, in case of data loss is explicitly rejected.

### Reporting obligations

You will immediately report any knowledge of a misuse of your booked services.

### Cooperation

If the maintenance of service quality requires your cooperation, for example to remedy errors in the services you use, you will provide said cooperation promptly and free of charge.

### Third party obligations

You will ensure that your vicarious agents, customers and third parties fulfill these obligations as well.

## Financial

### Termination by us

We may terminate the Framework Agreement at any time via email message with a notice period of 90 days. Any use of the services will cease at the end of this period and the Framework Agreement will be terminated.

### Termination of services

We are entitled to suspend and terminate services used by you if

* Other customers&#39; services are being negatively affected in breach of the fair use provision, including in the event of your services being subject to attacks by third parties (i.e. DoS/DDoS attacks);
* We consider the suspension or termination of the services to be necessary for the protection of ourselves, our infrastructure or other customers.

We reserve the right to immediately terminate the Framework Agreement in such cases.
