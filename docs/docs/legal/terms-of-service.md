If such modification would have a disadvantageous impact on the Customer use of service, Zitadel and Customer must discuss the change with the Customer first and, to the best of its ability, find a solution that is acceptable to both Parties.
If such a solution cannot be found, Zitadel may implement the modification and Customer may submit notice of termination of the relevant Service (email is sufficient) before the modification becomes effective without being obliged to pay contractual penalties or termination fees.
