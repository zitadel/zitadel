## Our Services

### Type and scope of the services

### Modifications of services offered

We are entitled to offer new services, to withdraw existing services (**Termination**) or to modify the specifications and prices of existing services (**Modification**) at any time.
If the modification or termination affects a service that you are using at that time, we will inform you via email that said service will be automatically modified and/or is no longer available after a period of 30 days.

If such modification would have a disadvantageous impact on the Customer use of service, Zitadel and Customer must discuss the change with the Customer first and, to the best of its ability, find a solution that is acceptable to both Parties.
If such a solution cannot be found, Zitadel may implement the modification and Customer may submit notice of termination of the relevant Service (email is sufficient) before the modification becomes effective without being obliged to pay contractual penalties or termination fees.
Zitadel may modify the prices for a service after the minimum term of the agreement.

You may, where applicable, add more Services (e.g. add-ons) to your existing Services at any time.
