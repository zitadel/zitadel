:::info
**This is a Management API Client, not an Authentication SDK.**

This library is designed for server-to-server communication to manage your Zitadel instance (e.g., creating users, managing projects, and updating settings). It is **not** intended for handling end-user login flows in your web application. For user authentication, you should use a standard OIDC library with your PHP framework of choice.
:::

The Zitadel PHP Client provides an idiomatic way to access the full gamut of
Zitadel's v2 Management APIs from your PHP backend.

### Status: Incubating

> Please be aware that this client library is currently in an **incubating stage**.
While it is available for use, the API and its functionality may evolve, potentially introducing
breaking changes in future updates. We advise caution when considering it for production environments.

### Installation

You can add the client library to your project using Composer:

```bash
composer require zitadel/client
```

### Versioning

The client library's versioning is aligned with the Zitadel core project. The major version of the client corresponds to the major version of Zitadel it is designed to work with. For example, v2.x.x of the client is built for and tested against Zitadel v2, ensuring a predictable and stable integration.
