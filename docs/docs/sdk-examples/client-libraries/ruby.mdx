:::info
**This is a Management API Client, not an Authentication SDK.**

This library is designed for server-to-server communication to manage your Zitadel instance (e.g., creating users, managing projects, and updating settings). It is **not** intended for handling end-user login flows in your web application. For user authentication, you should use a standard OIDC library with your Ruby framework of choice.
:::

The Zitadel Ruby Client provides an idiomatic way to access the full gamut of Zitadel's v2 Management APIs from your Ruby backend.

> Please be aware that this client library is currently in an **incubating stage**.
While it is available for use, the API and its functionality may evolve, potentially introducing
breaking changes in future updates. We advise caution when considering it for production environments.

### Installation

You can add the client library to your project using RubyGems. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem install zitadel-client --pre
```

### Using the SDK

Your SDK offers three ways to authenticate with Zitadel. Each method has its
own benefitsâ€”choose the one that fits your situation best.

#### 1. Private Key JWT Authentication

**What is it?**
You use a JSON Web Token (JWT) that you sign with a private key stored in a
JSON file. This process creates a secure token.

**When should you use it?**

- **Best for production:** It offers strong security.
- **Advanced control:** You can adjust token settings like expiration.

**How do you use it?**

1. Save your private key in a JSON file.
2. Use the provided method to create an authenticator.

**Example:**

```ruby
require 'zitadel-client'
require 'securerandom'

client = Zitadel::Client::Zitadel.with_private_key("https://example.us1.zitadel.cloud", "path/to/jwt-key.json")

begin
  response = client.users.add_human_user(
    Zitadel::Client::UserServiceAddHumanUserRequest.new(
      username: SecureRandom.hex,
      profile: Zitadel::Client::UserServiceSetHumanProfile.new(
        given_name: 'John',
        family_name: 'Doe'
      ),
      email: Zitadel::Client::UserServiceSetHumanEmail.new(
        email: "john.doe@example.com"
      )
    )
  )
  puts "User created: #{response}"
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}"
end
```

#### 2. Client Credentials Grant

**What is it?**
This method uses a client ID and client secret to get a secure access token,
which is then used to authenticate.

**When should you use it?**

- **Simple and straightforward:** Good for server-to-server communication.
- **Trusted environments:** Use it when both servers are owned or trusted.

**How do you use it?**

1. Provide your client ID and client secret.
2. Use the provided method to create an authenticator.

**Example:**

```ruby
require 'zitadel-client'
require 'securerandom'

client = Zitadel::Client::Zitadel.with_client_credentials("https://example.us1.zitadel.cloud", "id", "secret")

begin
  response = client.users.add_human_user(
    Zitadel::Client::UserServiceAddHumanUserRequest.new(
      username: SecureRandom.hex,
      profile: Zitadel::Client::UserServiceSetHumanProfile.new(
        given_name: 'John',
        family_name: 'Doe'
      ),
      email: Zitadel::Client::UserServiceSetHumanEmail.new(
        email: "john.doe@example.com"
      )
    )
  )
  puts "User created: #{response}"
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}"
end
```

#### 3. Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

**What is it?**
A Personal Access Token (PAT) is a pre-generated token that you can use to
authenticate without exchanging credentials every time.

**When should you use it?**

- **Easy to use:** Great for development or testing scenarios.
- **Quick setup:** No need for dynamic token generation.

**How do you use it?**

1. Obtain a valid personal access token from your account.
2. Use the provided method to create an authenticator.

**Example:**

```ruby
require 'zitadel-client'
require 'securerandom'

client = Zitadel::Client::Zitadel.with_access_token("https://example.us1.zitadel.cloud", "token")

begin
  response = client.users.add_human_user(
    Zitadel::Client::UserServiceAddHumanUserRequest.new(
      username: SecureRandom.hex,
      profile: Zitadel::Client::UserServiceSetHumanProfile.new(
        given_name: 'John',
        family_name: 'Doe'
      ),
      email: Zitadel::Client::UserServiceSetHumanEmail.new(
        email: "john.doe@example.com"
      )
    )
  )
  puts "User created: #{response}"
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}"
end
```

Choose the authentication method that best suits your needs based on your
environment and security requirements. For more details, please refer to the
[Zitadel documentation on authenticating service users](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/service-users/authenticate-service-users).

### Debugging

The SDK supports debug logging, which can be enabled for troubleshooting
and debugging purposes. You can enable debug logging by setting the `debug`
flag to `true` when initializing the `Zitadel` client, like this:

```ruby
zitadel = zitadel.Zitadel("your-zitadel-base-url", 'your-valid-token', lambda config: config.debug = True)
```

When enabled, the SDK will log additional information, such as HTTP request
and response details, which can be useful for identifying issues in the
integration or troubleshooting unexpected behavior.

### Versioning

The client library's versioning is aligned with the Zitadel core project. The major version of the
client corresponds to the major version of Zitadel it is designed to work with. For example,
v2.x.x of the client is built for and tested against Zitadel v2, ensuring a predictable and stable integration.
