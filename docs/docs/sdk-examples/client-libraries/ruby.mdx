:::info
**This is a Management API Client, not an Authentication SDK.**

This library is designed for server-to-server communication to manage your Zitadel instance (e.g., creating users, managing projects, and updating settings). It is **not** intended for handling end-user login flows in your web application. For user authentication, you should use a standard OIDC library with your Ruby framework of choice.
:::

The Zitadel Ruby Client provides an idiomatic way to access the full gamut of Zitadel's v2 Management APIs from your Ruby backend.[1]

### Status

We have recently released this client library and are actively collecting feedback for improvements.
While we are committed to preserving the public API, we do advise a degree of caution when using it
in production environments.

### Installation

You can add the client library to your project using RubyGems. Add this line to your application's Gemfile [3]:

```ruby
gem 'zitadel-client'
```

### Versioning

The client library's versioning is aligned with the Zitadel core project.
The major version of the client corresponds to the major version of Zitadel it is
designed to work with. For example, v2.x.x of the client is built for and tested against
Zitadel v2, ensuring a predictable and stable integration.
