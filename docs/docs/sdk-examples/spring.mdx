## Overview

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a powerful, production-ready framework for building Java applications. This example shows how to integrate **ZITADEL** into a Spring Boot web application using **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** and the **Authorization Code Flow + PKCE**.

It demonstrates a common web app pattern: users start on a public landing page, authenticate with ZITADEL via a login button, and are then redirected to a protected profile page that displays user information. Logout is also implemented to end both the local session and the ZITADEL session.

#### Auth library

This example uses **[Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)**, the standard framework for authentication and access control in Spring applications. Spring Security supports OIDC natively and manages the PKCE flow for you.

---

## What this example demonstrates

This example shows a complete authentication implementation using Spring Security’s OAuth 2.0 / OIDC support:

- **Public landing page** (`/`) accessible without authentication.
- **Sign-in with ZITADEL** via Spring Security’s OAuth2 login entrypoint.
- **Route protection** so authenticated access is required for protected routes (e.g. `/profile`).
- **Profile page** that renders the authenticated user’s OIDC claims.
- **Server-side session management** handled by the servlet container + Spring Security.
- **Federated logout** that clears the local session and triggers RP-initiated logout against ZITADEL, returning the user to a post-logout callback route.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

#### System Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Maven (or use the included `mvnw` wrapper)

#### Account Setup

You’ll need a ZITADEL account and an application configured for a Web app using Authorization Code + PKCE.

> **Important:** Configure the following URLs in your ZITADEL application settings:
>
> - **Redirect URIs:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
> - **Post Logout Redirect URIs:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/logout/callback`
>
> These URLs must exactly match what your Spring Boot application uses. For production, add your production URLs.

### Run the example

1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your ZITADEL details.

```dotenv
# Port number where your Spring Boot server will listen for incoming HTTP requests.
PORT=3000

# Session timeout in seconds. Users will be automatically logged out after this
# duration of inactivity. 3600 seconds = 1 hour.
SESSION_DURATION=3600

# Your ZITADEL instance domain URL. Include the full https:// URL.
ZITADEL_DOMAIN="https://your-zitadel-domain"

# Application Client ID from your ZITADEL application settings.
ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"

# Provide a randomly generated string here.
ZITADEL_CLIENT_SECRET="your-randomly-generated-client-secret"
```

3. Build and start the server:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:zitadel/example-auth-spring.git
cd example-auth-spring

# 2. Build the project and download dependencies
mvn clean install

# 3. Start the development server
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` and walk through login → profile → logout.
