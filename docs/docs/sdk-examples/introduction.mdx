---

You can integrate ZITADEL quickly into your application and be up and running within minutes.
To achieve your goals as fast as possible, we provide you with SDKs, Example Repositories and Guides.

The SDKs and integration depend on the framework and language you are using.

:::note
In addition to our officially maintained examples, we also list community-contributed implementations.
These examples are provided by external developers and are not maintained by us.
While we believe they can be valuable resources and showcase diverse approaches, we cannot guarantee their completeness, functionality, or continued support.
If you encounter issues with a community-contributed example, please contact the respective maintainers directly.
We provide this list for informational purposes and to foster community engagement, but we do not assume responsibility for these external implementations.

import { Frameworks } from "../../src/components/frameworks";

## Clients

<Frameworks filter={(framework) => framework.client === true } />

## SDKs

<Frameworks filter={(framework) => framework.sdk === true } />

## Resources

<Frameworks filter={(framework) => framework.client === false || framework.client == null} />

To further streamline your setup, simply visit the console in ZITADEL where you can select one of the languages or frameworks. This will allow you to instantly set up the configuration for that specific sample in ZITADEL, ensuring you have everything you need to get started right away.

## OIDC Libraries

OIDC is a standard for authentication and most languages and frameworks do provide a OIDC library which can be easily integrated to your application.
If we do not provide an specific example, SDK or guide, we strongly recommend using existing authentication libraries for your
language or framework instead of building your own.
Certified libraries have undergone rigorous testing and validation to ensure high security and reliability.
There are many recommended libraries available, this saves time and ensures that users' data is well-protected.

You might want to check out the following links to find a good library:

## Other example applications

- [B2B customer portal](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-nextjs-b2b): Showcase the use of personal access tokens in a B2B environment. Uses NextJS Framework.
- [Frontend with backend API](https://github.com/zitadel/example-quote-generator-app): A simple web application using a React front-end and a Python back-end API, both secured using ZITADEL
- [Introspection](https://github.com/zitadel/examples-api-access-and-token-introspection): Python examples for securing an API and invoking it as a service user
- [Fine-grained authorization](https://github.com/zitadel/example-fine-grained-authorization): Leverage actions, custom metadata, and claims for attribute-based access control

## Missing SDK

Is your language/framework missing? Fear not, you can generate your gRPC API Client with ease.

1. Make sure to install [buf](https://buf.build/docs/installation/)
2. Create a `buf.gen.yaml` and configure the [plugins](https://buf.build/plugins) you need
3. Run `buf generate https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel#format=git,tag=v2.23.1` (change the versions to your needs)

Let us make an example with Ruby. Any other supported language by buf will work as well. Consult
the [buf plugin registry](https://buf.build/plugins) for more ideas.

### Example with Ruby

With gRPC we usually need to generate the client stub and the messages/types. This is why we need two plugins.
The plugin `grpc/ruby` generates the client stub and the plugin `protocolbuffers/ruby` takes care of the messages/types.

```yaml
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: buf.build/grpc/ruby
    out: gen
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/ruby
    out: gen
```

If you now run `buf generate https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel#format=git,tag=v2.23.1` in the folder where
your `buf.gen.yaml` is located you should see the folder `gen` appear.

If you run `ls -la gen/zitadel/` you should see something like this:

```bash
ffo@ffo-pc:~/git/zitadel/ruby$ ls -la gen/zitadel/
