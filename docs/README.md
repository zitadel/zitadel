# ZITADEL-Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The documentation is part of the ZITADEL monorepo and uses **pnpm** and **Nx** for development and build processes.

## Quick Start

Run the following commands from the repositorys root directory to install all dependencies needed.
Using Corepack makes sure you have the pnpm version intalled that is declared in [](../package.json).

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

Start a docs server

```bash
# Start development server with live-reloading
pnpm nx run @zitadel/docs:dev

# Or serve a production build
pnpm nx run @zitadel/docs:start
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:3100

## Add new Sites to existing Topics

To add a new site to the already existing structure simply save the `md` file into the corresponding folder and append the sites id int the file `sidebars.js`.

If you are introducing new APIs (gRPC), you need to add a new entry to `docusaurus.config.js` under the `plugins` section.

## Build Process

The documentation build process automatically:

1. **Downloads required protoc plugins** - Ensures `protoc-gen-connect-openapi` is available
2. **Generates gRPC documentation** - Creates API docs from proto files
3. **Generates API documentation** - Creates OpenAPI specification docs
4. **Copies configuration files** - Includes configuration examples
5. **Builds the Docusaurus site** - Generates the final static site
