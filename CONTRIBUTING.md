# Contributing to Zitadel

Zitadel is an open-source identity and access management platform built with a modern tech stack including Go (API), Next.js/React (Login), Angular (Console), and Docusaurus (Docs) - all orchestrated through an Nx monorepo with pnpm for efficient development workflows.

## Quick Start

This repository contains multiple interconnected projects.
You can build and start any project with Nx commands:

| Task | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Production** | `pnpm nx run PROJECT:prod` | Production server |
| **Develop** | `pnpm nx run PROJECT:dev` | Development server |
| **Generate** | `pnpm nx run PROJECT:generate` | Generate files |
| **Test** | `pnpm nx run PROJECT:test` | Run tests |
| **Lint** | `pnpm nx run PROJECT:lint` | Check code style |
| **Lint Fix** | `pnpm nx run PROJECT:lint-fix` | Auto-fix style issues |

Replace `PROJECT` with one of the following:

- `@zitadel/zitadel` (you can omit this root level project when using `pnpm nx run`, like `pnpm nx run db`)
- `@zitadel/api`
- `@zitadel/login`
- `@zitadel/console`
- `@zitadel/docs`
- `@zitadel/client`
- `@zitadel/proto`

Instead of the project names, you can also use their directory names for `PROJECT`, like `pnpm nx run login:dev`.
Alternatively, you can use the infix-notation, like `pnpm nx dev @zitadel/login` or `pnpm nx dev login`.

### <a name="api-quick-start"></a>API

Make sure you have the [required system dependencies](#dev-requirements) and node modules installed

```bash
pnpm install
```

Prepare the API development with a Console and run a local Login production build.

```bash
pnpm nx run-many --projects @zitadel/api --targets generate build-console
pnpm nx run-many --projects . @zitadel/login --targets db prod
```

Start a debug session in your IDE.
In VSCode, you can use the preconfigured [launch config](./.vscode/launch.json).
In other IDEs, adjust accordingly.

Visit http://localhost:8080/ui/console?login_hint=zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost and enter `Password1!` to log in.

If you don't need a Login or a Console, you can omit them and use the generated ./admin.pat to call the API.

```bash
pnpm nx run-many --projects . @zitadel/api --targets db generate
```

Call the API using [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) or [grpcui](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui), for example:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat admin.pat)" localhost:8080 zitadel.user.v2.UserService.ListUsers
```

To connect to the database and explore Zitadel data, run `psql "host=${DEVCONTAINER_DB_HOST:-localhost} dbname=zitadel sslmode=disable"`.

For more options, go to the [API section](#api)

### <a name="login-quick-start"></a>Login

Make sure you have the [required system dependencies](#dev-requirements) and node modules installed

```bash
pnpm install
```

Develop the Login and connect a local API with a local DB

```bash
pnpm nx run-many --projects . @zitadel/api --targets db prod
```

In another terminal, start the Login development server

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/login:dev
```

Visit http://localhost:8080/ui/console?login_hint=zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost and enter `Password1!` to log in.

Make some changes to the source code and see how the browser is automatically updated.

For more options, go to the [Login section](#login)

### <a name="console-quick-start"></a>Console

Make sure you have the [required system dependencies](#dev-requirements) and node modules installed

```bash
pnpm install
```

Develop the Console and connect a local API with a local Login and DB:

```bash
pnpm nx run-many --projects . @zitadel/api @zitadel/login --targets db prod
```

In another terminal, start the console development server

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/console:dev
```

To allow Console access via http://localhost:4200, you have to configure the Zitadel API.

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ui/console/projects.
3. Select the _ZITADEL_ project.
4. Select the _Console_ application.
5. Select _Redirect Settings_

### General Guidelines

#### Gender Neutrality and Inclusive Language

We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community for all developers, regardless of their gender identity or expression. To achieve this, we are actively working to ensure that our contribution guidelines are gender-neutral and use inclusive language.

**Use gender-neutral pronouns**:
Don't use gender-specific pronouns unless the person you're referring to is actually that gender.
In particular, don't use he, him, his, she, or her as gender-neutral pronouns, and don't use he/she or (s)he or other such punctuational approaches. Instead, use the singular they.

**Choose gender-neutral alternatives**:
Opt for gender-neutral terms instead of gendered ones whenever possible.
Replace "policeman" with "police officer," "manpower" with "workforce," and "businessman" with "entrepreneur" or "businessperson."

**Avoid ableist language**:
Ableist language includes words or phrases such as crazy, insane, blind to or blind eye to, cripple, dumb, and others.
Choose alternative words depending on the context.

### API

Zitadel follows an API first approach. This means all features can not only be accessed via the UI but also via the API.
The API is designed to be used by different clients, such as web applications, mobile applications, and other services.
Therefore, the API is designed to be easy to use, consistent, and reliable.
Please check out the dedicated [API guidelines](./API_DESIGN.md) page when contributing to the API.

## <a name="api"></a>Contribute API Code

To start developing the Zitadel API Go application, make sure your system has the [required system dependencies](#dev-requirements) installed.
Get familiar with the [API quick start](#api-quick-start).

### Run Local Unit Tests

To test the code without dependencies, run the unit tests:

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/api:test-unit
```

### Run Local Functional API Tests (Formerly Called Integration Tests)

Functional API tests are run as gRPC clients against a running Zitadel server binary.
The server binary is [built with coverage enabled](https://go.dev/doc/build-cover).

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/api:test-integration
```

To develop and run the test cases from within your IDE or by the command line, start only the API.
The actual integration test clients reside in the `integration_test` subdirectory of the package they aim to test.
Integration test files use the `integration` build tag, in order to be excluded from regular unit tests.
Because of the server-client split, Go is usually unaware of changes in server code and tends to cache test results.
Pass `-count 1` to disable test caching.

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/api:test-integration-app
```

Example command to run a single package integration test:

```bash
go test -count 1 -tags integration ./internal/api/grpc/management/integration_test
```

To run all available integration tests:

```bash
go test -count 1 -tags integration -parallel 1 $(go list -tags integration ./... | grep -e \"integration_test\" -e \"events_testing\")
```

It is also possible to run an API sever itself in a debugger and run the integrations tests like that.
In order to run the server, a database with correctly set up data is required.
When starting the debugger, make sure the Zitadel binary gets the flag `--config=./apps/api/test-integration.yaml`

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/api:test-integration-state
```

To cleanup after testing (deletes the ephemeral database!):

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/devcontainer:compose down db-api-integration cache-api-integration
```

The test binary has the race detector enabled. `api_integration_server_stop` checks for any race logs reported by Go and will print them along a `66` exit code when found.
Note that the actual race condition may have happened anywhere during the server lifetime, including start, stop or serving gRPC requests during tests.

### Run Local Functional UI Tests

To test the whole system, including the Console UI and the Login UI, run the Functional UI tests.

```bash
# If you made changes in the tests/functional-ui directory, make sure you reformat the files
pnpm nx run @zitadel/functional-ui:lint-fix

# Run the tests
pnpm nx run test-functional:test --browser electron

# Beware that firefox and chrome are not installed in the dev container.
pnpm nx run test-functional:test --browser firefox
pnpm nx run test-functional:test --browser chrome
```

### Run Local Functional UI Tests Against Your Dev Server Console

If you also make [changes to the Console](#console), you can run the test suite against your locally built API and Console server.

```bash
# Run the API
pnpm nx run @zitadel/functional-ui:test-env
```

In another terminal, open the interactive test suite

```bash
# The open command is configured to run against http://localhost:4200 by default
pnpm nx run @zitadel/functional-ui:open
```

## <a name="frontend"></a>Contribute Frontend Code

This repository uses **pnpm** as package manager and **Nx** for build orchestration.

### Quick Start

Make sure you have the [development requirements](#dev-requirements) installed.

**Start developing***

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm nx run @zitadel/login:dev # or console:dev or docs:dev
```

### Project Overview

Choose your contribution area:

- **[Login App](#login)** (Next.js/React) - Modern authentication flows
- **[Console](#console)** (Angular) - Admin dashboard and user management
- **[Docs](#docs)** (Docusaurus) - Project documentation
- **[Client Packages](#client-packages)** - Shared libraries for API communication

### Project Dependencies

```
apps/login ‚Üí packages/zitadel-client ‚Üí packages/zitadel-proto
console ‚Üí packages/zitadel-client ‚Üí packages/zitadel-proto
docs ‚Üí (independent)
```

**Nx handles this automatically** - when you change `zitadel-proto`, Nx rebuilds dependent projects.

### <a name="client-packages"></a>Client Packages

**`@zitadel/proto`**: Protocol buffer definitions and generated TypeScript/JavaScript clients.
```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/proto:generate  # Regenerate after proto changes
```

**`@zitadel/client`**: High-level TypeScript client library with utilities for API interaction.
```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/client:build  # Build after changes
```

### <a name="login"></a>Contribute to Login

The Login UI is a Next.js application that provides the user interface for authentication flows.
It is MIT-licensed, so you are free to change and deploy it as you like.
It's located in the `apps/login` directory and uses pnpm and Nx for development.
To start developing the Login, make sure your system has the [required system dependencies](#dev-requirements) installed.
Get familiar with the [login quick start](#login-quick-start) and the [Login ui docs](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/login-ui).

#### Develop against a Cloud instance

If you don't want to build and run a local API, you can just run the Login development server and point it to a cloud instance.

1. Create a personal access token and point your instance to your local Login, [as described in the Docs](https://zitadel.com/docs/self-hosting/manage/login-client).
2. Save the following file to `apps/login/.env.dev.local`

```env
ZITADEL_API_URL=https://[your-cloud-instance-domain]
ZITADEL_SERVICE_USER_TOKEN=[personal access token for an IAM Login Client]
```

3. Start the development server.

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/login:dev
```

Visit http://localhost:8080/ui/console?login_hint=zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost and enter `Password1!` to log in.

#### Login Architecture

The Login application consists of multiple packages:

- `@zitadel/login` - Main Next.js application
- `@zitadel/client` - TypeScript client library for Zitadel APIs
- `@zitadel/proto` - Protocol buffer definitions and generated code

The build process uses Nx and pnpm to orchestrate dependencies:

#### Pass Quality Checks

### <a name="console"></a>Contribute to Console

To start developing the Console, make sure your system has the [required system dependencies](#dev-requirements) installed.
To learn more about the Console, go to the Consoles [README.md](./console).
Get familiar with the [Console quick start](#console-quick-start).

#### Develop against a Cloud instance

If you don't want to build and run a local API, you can just run the console development server and point it to a cloud instance.

1. Save the following file to console/.env.local

```env
ENVIRONMENT_JSON_URL=https://[your-cloud-instance-domain]/ui/console/assets/environment.json
```

1. Start the development server.

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/console:dev
```

3. Allow your cloud instance to redirect to your local console, as described in the [Console quick start](#console-quick-start)

Visit http://localhost:4200/?login_hint=zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost and enter `Password1!` to log in.

#### Pass Quality Checks

Reproduce the pipeline quality checks for the code you changed.

```bash
# Run console-related linting builds and unit tests
pnpm nx run-many --projects @zitadel/console @zitadel/client @zitadel/proto @zitadel/functional-ui --targets lint build test

# Run the functional UI tests
pnpm nx run @zitadel/functional-ui:test-firefox
pnpm nx run @zitadel/functional-ui:test-chrome
```

Fix the quality checks, add new checks that cover your changes and mark your pull request as ready for review when the pipeline checks pass.

### <a name="docs"></a>Contribute to Docs

Project documentation is made with Docusaurus and is located under [./docs](./docs). The documentation uses **pnpm** and **Nx** for development and build processes.

To start developing the Docs, make sure your system has the [required system dependencies](#dev-requirements) installed.

#### Local Development

```bash
# Start development server (recommended)
pnpm nx run @zitadel/docs:dev

# Or start production server
pnpm nx run @zitadel/docs:prod
```

The Docs build process automatically:

1. Downloads required protoc plugins
2. Generates gRPC documentation from proto files
3. Generates API documentation from OpenAPI specs
4. Copies configuration files
5. Builds the Docusaurus site

#### Local testing

The documentation server will be available at http://localhost:3000 with live reload for fast development feedback.

#### Style guide

- **Code with variables**: Make sure that code snippets can be used by setting environment variables, instead of manually replacing a placeholder.
- **Embedded files**: When embedding mdx files, make sure the template ist prefixed by "\_" (lowdash). The content will be rendered inside the parent page, but is not accessible individually (eg, by search).
- **Don't repeat yourself**: When using the same content in multiple places, save and manage the content as separate file and make use of embedded files to import it into other docs pages.
- **Embedded code**: You can embed code snippets from a repository. See the [plugin](https://github.com/saucelabs/docusaurus-theme-github-codeblock#usage) for usage.

Following the [Google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) is highly recommended. Its clear and concise guidelines ensure consistency and effective communication within the wider developer community.

The style guide covers a lot of material, so their [highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) page provides an overview of its most important points. Some of the points stated in the highlights that we care about most are given below:

- Be conversational and friendly without being frivolous.
- Use sentence case for document titles and section headings.
- Use active voice: make clear who's performing the action.
- Use descriptive link text.

#### Docs pull request

When making a pull request use `docs(<scope>): <short summary>` as title for the semantic release.
Scope can be left empty (omit the brackets) or refer to the top navigation sections.

#### Pass Quality Checks

Verify the Docs build correctly.

```bash
pnpm nx run @zitadel/docs:build
```

Fix the quality checks, add new checks that cover your changes and mark your pull request as ready for review when the pipeline checks pass.

  For Cypress tests on WSL2, you may need to configure X11 forwarding. Following suggestions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62641553/setup-cypress-on-wsl-ubuntu-for-windows-10) and [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4106). Use at your own risk.

  1. Install `VcXsrv Windows X Server`
  2. Set shortcut target to `"C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\xlaunch.exe" -ac`
  3. In WSL2: `export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0`
  4. Disable access control when starting XLaunch

## <a name="translations"></a>Contribute Translations

Zitadel loads translations from four files:

- [Console texts](./console/src/assets/i18n)
- [Login interface](./internal/api/ui/login/static/i18n)
- [Email notification](./internal/notification/static/i18n)
- [Common texts](./internal/static/i18n) for success or error toasts

You may edit the texts in these files or create a new file for additional language support. Make sure you set the locale (ISO 639-1 code) as the name of the new language file.
Please make sure that the languages within the files remain in their own language, e.g. German must always be `Deutsch.
If you have added support for a new language, please also ensure that it is added in the list of languages in all the other language files.

You also have to add some changes to the following files:

- [Register Local File](./console/src/app/app.module.ts)
- [Add Supported Language](./console/src/app/utils/language.ts)
- [Customized Text Docs](./docs/docs/guides/manage/customize/texts.md)
- [Add language option](./internal/api/ui/login/static/templates/external_not_found_option.html)

## **Did you find a security flaw?**

- Please read [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Product management

The Zitadel Team works with an agile product management methodology.
You can find all the issues prioritized and ordered in the [product board](https://github.com/orgs/zitadel/projects/2/views/1).

### Sprint

We want to deliver a new release every second week. So we plan everything in two-week sprints.
Each Tuesday we estimate new issues and on Wednesday the last sprint will be reviewed and the next one will be planned.
After a sprint ends a new version of Zitadel will be released, and publish to [Zitadel Cloud](https://zitadel.cloud) the following Monday.

If there are some critical or urgent issues we will have a look at it earlier, than the two weeks.
To show the community the needed information, each issue gets attributes and labels.

### About the attributes

You can find the attributes on the project "Product Management".

#### State

The state should reflect the progress of the issue and what is going on right now.

- **No status**: Issue just got added and has to be looked at.
- **üßê Investigating**: We are currently investigating to find out what the problem is, which priority it should have and what has to be implemented. Or we need some more information from the author.
- **üì® Product backlog**: If an issue is in the backlog, it is not currently being worked on. These are recorded so that they can be worked on in the future. Issues with this state do not have to be completely defined yet.
- **üìù Prioritized product backlog**: An issue with the state "Prioritized Backlog" is ready for the refinement from the perspective of the product owner (PO) to implement. This means the developer can find all the relevant information and acceptance criteria in the issue.
- **üîñ Ready**: The issue is ready to take into a sprint. Difference to "prioritized..." is that the complexity is defined by the team.
- **üìã Sprint backlog**: The issue is scheduled for the current sprint.
- **üèó In progress**: Someone is working on this issue right now. The issue will get an assignee as soon as it is in progress.
- **‚ùå Blocked**: The issue is blocked until another issue is resolved/done.
- **üëÄ In review**: The issue is in review. Please add someone to review your issue or let us know that it is ready to review with a comment on your pull request.
- **‚úÖ Done**: The issue is implemented and merged to main.

#### Priority

Priority shows you the priority the Zitadel team has given this issue. In general the higher the demand from customers and community for the feature, the higher the priority.

- **üåã Critical**: This is a security issue or something that has to be fixed urgently, because the software is not usable or highly vulnerable.
- **üèî High**: These are the issues the Zitadel team is currently focusing on and will be implemented as soon as possible.
- **üèï Medium**: After all the high issues are done these will be next.
- **üèù Low**: This is low in priority and will probably not be implemented in the next time or just if someone has some time in between.

#### Complexity

This should give you an indication how complex the issue is. It's not about the hours or effort it takes.
Everything that is higher than 8 should be split in smaller parts.

**1**, **2**, **3**, **5**, **8**, **13**

### About the labels

There are a few general labels that don't belong to a specific category.

- **good first issue**: This label shows contributors, that it is an easy entry point to start developing on Zitadel.
- **help wanted**: The author is seeking help on this topic, this may be from an internal Zitadel team member or external contributors.

#### Category

The category shows which part of Zitadel is affected.

- **category: backend**: The backend includes the APIs, event store, command and query side. This is developed in golang.
- **category: ci**: ci is all about continuous integration and pipelines.
- **category: design**: All about the ux/ui of Zitadel
- **category: docs**: Adjustments or new documentations, this can be found in the docs folder.
- **category: frontend**: The frontend concerns on the one hand the Zitadel management Console (Angular) and on the other hand the Login (gohtml)
- **category: infra**: Infrastructure does include many different parts. E.g Terraform-provider, docker, metrics, etc.
- **category: translation**: Everything concerning translations or new languages

#### Language

The language shows you in which programming language the affected part is written

- **lang: angular**
- **lang: go**
- **lang: javascript**
