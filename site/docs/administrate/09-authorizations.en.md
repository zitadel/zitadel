### ZITADEL's management Roles

ZITADEL's own role model is built around the IAM resource. The roles have some hierarchies to them. For example a IAM_OWNER can view and edit every resource of the system. ORG_OWNERS can only manage their resources included within their organisation. This includes projects, clients, users, and so on.
